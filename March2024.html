            The days are getting longer! Now, as I'm finishing up my workday,
            the sun is at the right angle to shine in my window and make my
            computer difficult to see, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            But winter weather has returned. We had a blizzard on tuesday that
            dumped 7+ inches of snow and brought a day or two of negative-degree
            weather. As I write this post, it's warmer (23 degrees F), but it is
            snowing like crazy! I bet we get another 2-3 inches!
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, I don't mind, as long as the temperatures are above single
            digits. When I lived in New York, we would get tons of snow, but the
            temperature was nice so it didn't matter. Snow is easier to deal
            with than -60 with wind chill.

        <section id="writing">
          <p>
            Not a lot of progress on the writing front, this month. I wrote a
            couple of essays that will likely never see the light of day, lol,
            but not much else. It still counts, since it is
            <strong>still</strong> exercising the writing muscle. It's just not
            anything I would ever publish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe the writers conference will inspire me. This month is the
            annual UND Writers Conference. As usual, I'm very excited to go.
            And, as usual, I bought a bunch of books from the authors that will
            be at the conference, but I haven't started reading any of them!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a little bummed out to discover I had already missed two new
            writers conference events. One of my former classmates and one of my
            favorite professors gave community workshops in poetry and fiction,
            separate from the community workshops that will be occurring during
            the conference. I would have <strong>LOVED</strong> to participate,
            but I didn't find out about them until too late. I hope they do it
            again next year!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is an exciting development on the writing front, though. It
            looks like there is finally going to be a northern chapter of the
            HWA covering my area. I'm very excited about that, even if it mostly
            just means meeting via Zoom (the chapter is going to cover a fairly
            large geographical area). It's going to be great finally being able
            to be a member of a chapter!
          </p>

        <section id="reading">
          <p>
            On the reading front, I <em>should</em> be reading some of the
            Writers Conference authors, but I haven't yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have three books I have been reading: Tales from Watership Down by
            Richard Adams, The Professor and the Madman by Simon Winchester, and
            I just finished Let Us Descend by Jesmyn Ward. The last one was
            loaned to me, and I think I may purchase a copy of my own. It is
            definitely one of those books that's so lyrical and
            thought-provoking that it begs for marginalia.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've got to start doing more reading before bedtime. I've gotten too
            much in the habit of playing on my phone before bed, and it's not
            healthy. I <em>used to</em> spend the last half hour before bed
            reading. Not only is reading a much healthier habit, it will also
            help put a dent in my "To be read" pile!

        <section id="education">
          <p>
            My class on web development is going pretty well, though it has had
            a few roller coaster moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love how organized the class is, the textbook is awesome, and the
            projects help with learning the course material. The professor did a
            great job in picking a text and assignments that help me learn the
            material.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the initial ProctorU experience (for the exam)
            was a disaster and there is a LOT of course material to go over each
            week (chapters in the textbook average around 100 pages, and there
            are usually four or more videos to watch every week). It can feel
            overwhelming sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, for the lectures, the sound quality in the room the professor
            is using is terrible. It seems to pick up the sound of student
            conversations better than the professor's lecture. And the
            transcript struggles, too. It's really no help at all. Here are
            three screenshots of recent transcripts from the lecture:
          </p>
          <img src="./images/Transcript1.png" />
          <img src="./images/Transcript2.png" />
          <img src="./images/Transcript3.png" />
          <p>
            Yep. Impossible to make heads or tails out of that. Granted, most
            transcription software isn't that great, but I think the bad sound
            quality in that room makes a big difference, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the struggles are worth it, because I have learned a lot. My
            HTML skills are already 10X better than they were before the class.
            I'm still doing this page on the old web template I was using, but I
            am developing a MUCH better template thanks to the new skills I've
            learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the things I've learned in this class is how to make better
            use of developer tools. I've used them in other html classes I've
            taken, but this class has taken more of a deep dive into how to use
            them most effectively. None of my other classes had explained how to
            follow the inheritance of styles in the developer tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            This class is also the first time I've learned about this awesome
            tool:
            <br />
            &ast; &lcub; <br />
            outline &colon; 1px dotted red &semi; <br />&rcub;
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm actually peeved that I never learned about it before this class!
            It's such a handy tool!
          </p>
          <p>
            For those that aren't familiar with writing html, in simplified
            terms, everything in html is a box. The code snippet above puts a
            dotted red-outline around every element (box) in your webpage. And
            this is SO VERY helpful in troubleshooting so many of the problems
            you might run into in creating the design and layout of a site. I
            use it all the time now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned that Google Developer Tools has a device emulator, so
            you can see what your site is going to look like on different
            devices!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've learned so much, and we are only at the midpoint of the
            semester!
          </p>
          <p>
            So now, the only thing I wish is that there was a Web Development II
            class.

          <p>
            Speaking of classes, I may *not* be changing my major to computer
            science. I sent an email to an advisor, asking for information on
            the major, what classes have I taken that already count toward it,
            etc. Since she's not an advisor in that department, she suggested I
            contact a computer science advisor. So I did . . .
          </p>
          <p>And nothing. crickets.</p>
          <p>
            Since it seems like everyone is sick with something around here
            lately, I waited a bit in case she was out sick (or on a cruise;
            lots of people around here take their vacations in February and go
            on a cruise).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we are into March, though, and I haven't heard anything. I'll
            email once more and see if I get a response. It could also be that
            she was on vacation and my email was one of the hundreds waiting for
            her when she returned, and it just got lost in the "pile." I've done
            that myself!
          </p>
          <p>
            So I'm hoping to hear back so I can get a good idea of what I will
            be up against if I do decide to change my major (like, will I have
            to take calculus? Eek!)

        <p>
          And, sort of related to computer classes, I saw something the other
          day where someone described GenX as having lived:
        </p>
        <p>Analog childhood, digital adulthood.</p>
        <p>
          I think that does describe GenXers pretty well, and it really stuck
          with me.

            This month's rant is a short one. This month, I'm ranting about:
            Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            No, I'm not going to complain about Google trying to be everywhere
            and everything. I long ago accepted that Google is just going to be
            in charge of all of my digital life, and I'm actually pretty okay
            with that, lol. "Let Google handle it."
          </p>
          <p>
            My problem is that Google keeps making different products/apps to
            run my digital life, and then it takes them away! This time, it's
            Google Podcasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back when I worked at the Mouse House, I listened to podcasts all
            day long. I started out on Podbean, but then I had problems with my
            subscriptions vanishing, episodes "falling out of the queue," etc.
            So I was pretty happy to find that Google had a podcase app. I moved
            all my podcasts over there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, though, Google is shutting it down. Granted, I can still listen
            to them on YouTube music, but I <strong>HATE</strong> using YouTube
            music for anything besides music. I don't like listening to podcasts
            on audible, either. I prefer to have a dedicated podcast app to
            manage and listen to podcasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I had to reinstall Podbean and re-download all my podcasts to it.
            I hope it isn't as problematic as it used to be. I don't listen to
            my podcasts very often anymore, but I still want them all organized
            and ready when I do want to listen. It bums me out that I've got to
            keep them outside of my "Google Life." I really do like having all
            my stuff so that it works together, but I'll be using Podbean unless
            Google comes up with something better for podcasts than YouTube
            music.
