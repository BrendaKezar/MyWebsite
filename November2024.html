            Fall has been hanging on. We usually have at least one snowstorm or
            blizzard by now, but not this year.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            That's a good thing because it gave me extra time to save fish. We
            removed the fish from the pond around the beginning of October. We
            always leave water in there to try and overwinter the lilies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I happened to be in the backyard just a few days ago, and something
            made me take a peek at the pond...and I saw several minnows swimming
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course I had to try and catch them and bring them inside. It's
            just too cruel to leave them out there to freeze. So now our careful
            plan (let's keep four big ones and six of the babies and give the
            rest to the pet store because it's so hard to maintain a ton of fish
            over the winter) has fallen by the wayside, and we are once again
            maintaining a ton of fish over the winter, lol!

          <h5>Writing update</h5>
          <p>
            My nonfiction project is underway! I've decided that I'm going to do
            NaNoWriMo this year (National Novel Writing Month), but instead of a
            novel, I'm going to use the word count (50,000 words in November;
            1667 words per day) to work on my non-fiction project. For day 1, I
            did 1730 words; for day 2, I did 1601. Woot!
          </p>
          <p>
            With all the other things I have going on right now (plus the
            general seasonal malaise that the darker days bring), I'm going to
            just focus on this project this month. No other writing projects
            will be attempted.
          </p>

          <h5>Reading Update</h5>
          <p>
            I am SO excited about my reading this month. My non-fiction project
            requires a lot of reading for research. And while I was adding some
            of the research books to my cart, I received a notification that one
            of my favorite writers, Louise Erdrich, has a book out that I
            haven't ready yet!
          </p>
          <p>
            So my plan for this month J(fingers crossed) is to spend a half an
            hour each night before bed reading Louise Erdrich's The Mighty Red.
          </p>

          <h5>What I'm watching this month</h5>
          <p>
            No new movies this month. It's been hard enough just keeping up with
            the reality-tv programs I enjoy watching: Survivor, 90-Day Fiance,
            Sister Wives, and House of Villians.

        <section id="education">
          <h5>Classes Update</h5>
          <p>
            I'm still doing all my normal learning apps for Spanish, HTML/CSS,
            and full-stack programming. And I've added 3-Minute French to the
            list.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm flying through the 3-Minute French course. I'm shocked by how
            much I still remember from my high school/early college days.
          </p>
          <p>
            My university class has me whooped. I don't know why. I don't know
            if it's the professor's teaching style (I really struggle with
            paying attention during the lectures), if I'm not putting the right
            kind of effort into it, or what the problem is.
          </p>
          <p>But I know I bombed the first quiz.</p>
          <p>
            Well, I'm pretty sure I bombed the first quiz. I don't actually know
            how I'm doing grade-wise because he's only graded the first two
            assignments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not sure why I'm struggling. It's not hard material. All of my
            programs have passed the auto-grader testing. Other classes I take,
            like the Udemy ones, I don't struggle with sitting through the
            lectures. So I don't think the class is "too hard" for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there hasn't been a lot of issues I've faced with some of the
            other classes. The quiz was done by another proctoring company, so I
            didn't have the "oh no, your professor gave us the wrong password
            for the test" issue like I had for the one class. And the professor
            for this class has good sound in the room, so there is no problem
            understanding what he is saying.
          </p>
          <p>But still I struggle!</p>
          <p>
            I have already started to try and soothe myself with the mantra: All
            you have to do is pass. Which, really, I don't even have to do that.
            I could totally fail this one and it will have no impact on my
            major. And, since I have 9 bajillion credits, it won't impact my GPA
            much, either. So I've just got to relax and try to get through it
            the best I can.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it still bothers me. Not just because I'm Type A and MUST get
            good grades. I actually like the logic of the class (program in four
            languages at once to see the similarities and differences), and I
            LOVE programming...always have. So it bums me out that I like the
            class but struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's definitely given me cause to rethink that whole, "Maybe I'll
            add a computer science minor/switch to computer science major." If I
            ever do decide to do that, I think I will probably start from
            scratch on it and go back to the 100-level classes and work my way
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next semster, I think I might finally be able to fulfill the
            "experience" requirement for the communication major. I talked to my
            advisor and found out that I can use my current job as the
            experience. I've set everything in motion for that, so as long as we
            haven't missed any deadlines, I'll be doing an internship at my own
            job next semester, lol. I'm not sure how it's going to work, but my
            boss is onboard and we have a special project all set for my
            internship hours.

          <p>The ten songs I'm listening to on repeat.</p>
          <p>
            I'm continually awed by how it is 2024 and my playlist is full of
            new music from Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche mode, Peter
            Gabriel, and Tears for Fears. Two of the ones listed this month
            (“Evil Woman,” Duran Duran's cover of the ELO hit, and “The Girl
            That I Call Home,” by Tears for Fears), I am absolutely obsessed
            with.
