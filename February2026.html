          <p>
            I saw a meme that said February is the final exam for wildlife, when
            fat reserves and food stores are at their lowest, snow is at its
            deepest, and temperatures are at their lowest. So I'm glad I came up
            with my odd little idea in late December.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had seen videos of people creating platforms to attract and feed
            crows. I want to get them used to coming in the yard before nesting
            season (so they will nest in my pines), but it's nearly impossible
            to sink a post here in winter. So it was either wait until spring or
            come up with another idea. Of course, patience has never been my
            strong suit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the same time, hubby cleaned out his workshop and was
            throwing away an old wooden high chair he had planned to restore but
            then decided not to.
          </p>
          <p>Light bulb!</p>
          <p>
            I set up the high chair and filled the tray with yummy things I
            thought crows would like: peanuts, corn, mealworms, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn't quite work out as intended. The crows are still in the
            front yard almost daily, digging french fries and chicken skins out
            of the neighborhood garbage cans. But the other birds seem to like
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As do the rabbits. Initially, the rabbits just ate whatever the
            birds knocked off the tray. But then one of them got smart and
            jumped up in the chair. I snapped this picture as her(?) friend
            seemed to be saying, "How the hell did you get up there?!"

          <h5>The writing update</h5>
          <p>
            I haven't succeeded in writing every day, but I have been writing at
            least 2 or 3 times a week. And each time, it's been longer than the
            15-minute goal I've set for myself. So I am making progress!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still working on the revision of my "Exit 0" story, and I'm
            working on a new story for a submission call.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also received an acceptance for one of my stories. The anthology
            looks really interesting, so I'm excited about reading it as well as
            about having a story in it!
          </p>
        </section>
        <img
          src="./images/NewestBar.png"

          <h5>What I'm reading</h5>
          <p>
            Aligning my reading with my walking goal has worked out really well.
            Plus, I've started reading for half an hour every night before bed.
            Between the two, I'm reading a ton!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm trying out the year-long lit challenge. This challenge involves
            reading a book a month on a specific theme or requirement. January's
            instruction was to read the first book in a series. February's is to
            read a book with a sports theme.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read <cite>The Circle</cite>, by Dave Eggers, for the January lit
            challenge. I wasn't crazy about the main character. She's pretty
            unlikeable and does really dumb stuff, but it becomes apparent why
            she's like this as the book draws to a close.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like it and though it was a creepy book. I think we are moving
            toward the excessive technological intrusions described in the
            story. We are already seeing folks using AI make fake memes of
            rivals being arrested or planes dumping crap on crowds. So the book
            is a timely read for this moment in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the February book, I'm listening to the audiobook of
            <cite>Indian Horse</cite>, by Richard Wagamese. The main character
            is taken from his family and sent to one of the Native boarding
            schools. He finds some solace to get him through the abuse and
            misery when he falls in love with hockey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read <cite>Man-Made Monsters,</cite> by Andrea Rogers. I borrowed
            this one from the library, but don't remember why I picked it up. I
            really enjoyed it, though. It's a series of horror short stories
            that follows a Cherokee family through the generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            I read two other borrowed books. <cite>The Hitch</cite> and
            <cite>Treasure Island</cite>, both by Sara Levine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read <cite>Treasure Island</cite> first. I moved from "Oh, this
            main character is quirky," to "Oh, dear. This main character has
            some serious mental issues," to "This main character is a
            psychopath."
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed <cite>The Hitch</cite> more, not just because it included
            a corgi but also because it was a really cute idea (a child
            possessed by a corgi). However, I really felt let down at the end of
            the book. I was more interested in the boy and the corgi, and
            instead, the last part of the book was just about the main
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solid writing for both books, but not my cup of tea. I have a hard
            time with main characters that I don't like.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my book clubs, I read <cite>The Spite House</cite>, by Johnny
            Compton, and <cite>The Edge of Collapse</cite>, by Kyla Stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <cite>The Spite House</cite> was another haunted house book, but I
            enjoyed this one better than the previous one. This one definitely
            felt more like horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            <cite>The Edge of Collapse</cite> is apocalyptic horror about an EMP
            pulse. It's part of a seven-book series, but I don't think I'll be
            reading more. It's about survivors, but it feels like it's written
            from a prepper's perspective. I understand the compulsion to be
            specific about details in a story, as that's one of the big
            "teaches" in most writing workshops. But in this first volume, the
            specifics (gun names, clothing choices, etc.) tended to distract me
            out of the story. It kind of made me feel like I was listening to
            "that crazy prepper neighbor talk about plans for when the
            government falls."
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, really solid writing and a good premise, but just not my cup
            of tea.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, of course, with the UND Writers Conference coming up in March,
            I'm trying to read at least one work from each attending author.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with <cite>Every Drop Is a Man's Nightmare</cite>, by
            Megan Kamalei Kakimoto. I made it through the first two stories, but
            I wasn't resonating with me. This one, I didn't finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I read <cite>And I Do Not Forgive You</cite>, by Amber Sparks,
            followed by <cite>Fablesque</cite>, by Anna Maria Hong, and
            <cite>Beowulf</cite>, by Maria Dahvana Headley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up in works by Writers Conference authors, I'm planning to read
            <cite>Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil</cite>, by Ananda Lima,
            and then something by George Saunders (I have several options).
          </p>
          <p>
            The final volume I plan on reading from Writers Conference authors
            is
            <cite
              >Algarabia: The Song of Cenex, Natural Son of the Isle of
              Alarabiyya</cite
            >, by Roque Raquel Salas Rivera. I'm extra excited about this one
            because, although I didn't know it when I purchased it, this novel
            is like an electronics manual: the front part is the book in
            English, the back part is the book in Spanish. Since I'm trying to
            learn Spanish, I'm looking forward to reading this one in English
            and then trying to muddle through the Spanish in a second read.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, as if all that wasn't enough, I'm also reading through works
            eligible for the Stoker awards. Though I've been a member of the HWA
            for years, I've never bothered voting. I thought I'd start, though,
            since I'm trying to be more involved in my "writing life." And, of
            course, I can't vote for something unless I know what I'm voting
            for, so I have to read them. And these, mostly, have been very much
            my cup of tea (with a few exceptions).

          <h5>What I've been watching</h5>
          <p>
            I still have a lot of AI movies to watch, but movie time has been
            overshadowed by all the reading I'm doing, and I only carved out
            time for two movies last month.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first was <cite>Replicas</cite>, starring Keanu Reeves. I'm a
            big fan of Keanu, but this movie stunk. I've heard more believable
            dialogue in pornos. And plot holes galore! Did he just leave his car
            in the lake and figure no one would notice? Where was his friend
            going to "hide" the bodies? How did he manage to steal all those
            batteries?
          </p>
          <p>So...many...plotholes. Ugh.</p>
          <p>
            The other movie I watched was <cite>Predator: Badlands</cite>, and I
            loved it. It was a fresh take on the Predator franchise and one of
            the best movies I've seen in a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know some people like a movie when it strays from the franchise's
            normal content or storylines, but I don't mind it. It's necessary, I
            think, to breathe new life into a long-term franchise. I feel the
            same way about Alien: Earth. I loved it, and I love the fresh takes
            it brings to the Alien franchise. I watched all of season 1, and I'm
            on board for season 2.

          <h5>Education update</h5>
          <p>
            I started my new class at the university, and it's been a bit of a
            let-down. There's no published schedule (as in, "week one we are
            covering....week two this assignment will be due...etc."). I like
            having a schedule as part of the syllabus, just so I have a
            "touchstone" to know where I should be at in my readings or
            assignments. Even if it means the schedule has to be readjusted at
            times (which it usually does for most classes), I prefer to have
            that visible framework to at least have an idea of where things are
            going and what benchmarks may be coming up.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've also had a lot of "series of unfortunate events" things where
            lectures have been delayed or even cancelled due to bad weather, the
            professor traveling, or the professor being ill, so it feels like we
            are three weeks in and we've hardly had class at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my other self-study stuff is the same. I'm trying to focus a
            little more on Udemy JavaScript and doing a module there at least
            daily, while not focusing so much on my Codecademy course (which I
            don't feel like I'm getting a lot out of).
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of Udemy, I'm a bit apprehensive about how Udemy will
            function in the future. I recently learned that they have been
            purchased by Coursera. Coursera, however, is generally double the
            price of Udemy for a yearly subscription. I've really enjoyed my
            Udemy courses, but I won't be sticking with them if the price
            doubles at my next renewal. So I may end up having to find a new
            primary learning platform late next summer, which I will be so
            bummed about because Udemy has been so great.

          <h5>This month's editorial.</h5>

          <p>
            While I don't think AI is poised to take over the world just yet, I
            also don't take the warnings against it lightly. Aside from the
            horrible drain on resources that it is, I've read about how earlier
            AI models lied, blackmailed, etc. And the AI I work with regularly,
            which has been "trained" to respond to me, gets a little creepy at
            times, and it's a good reminder of the potential danger.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of getting back into writing, I've been asking my AI to
            provide daily writing prompts. Here is an example:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="./images/AIPromptHeader.png"
              alt="screenshot of AI conversation"
              class="mypic"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look closely, you'll see a weird little icon or graphic in
            front of the headline. It's a triangle with a line through it near
            the top. The AI has been doing that, every day, and the image is
            different almost every day. So I finally asked it what the random
            image was and why it was there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="./images/AIExplanationIcon.png"
              alt="screenshot of AI converstion"
              class="mypic"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah. That's not creepy at all. My AI not only decided to spice up
            the prompts with random images, but it also assigned MEANING to
            those images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why does this make me feel like my air fryer just crawled across the
            counter, opened the spice cupboard, and threw some extra Cajun spice
            into itself to improve my dish?
          </p>
          <p>And speaking of AI...</p>
          <p>
            Most publishers don't accept AI work. Any work submitted has to be
            written by a human, and I'm completely in agreement with that. Leave
            art to the humans, please.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I saw a notice from a well-known publisher that takes the AI
            prohibition a little farther:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="./images/AIProhibition.png"
              alt="screenshot prohibiting use of AI"
              class="mypic"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I have used Grammarly, ProWritingAid, and other editing software for
            years to polish my final drafts, long before generative AI was
            incorporated, and I never would have thought that it might be a
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can understand if people are having AI rewrite their work, but all
            I've seen Grammarly do is suggest a different word choice if I've
            repeated a word too often, or if I've used it wrong, or if I'm
            writing too colloquially (sometimes a "should of" sneaks into my
            writing, even though I know better).
          </p>
          <p>So I'm a little bewildered at the prohibition!</p>
          <p>
            Of course, it could be that there's more to Grammarly these days
            than I'm aware of. I've used it so long, in the same way, and I
            don't play around with new features that are rolled out very often.
            So it could have problematic features that I'm not even aware of.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess I'll have to hope that the "no Grammarly" rule doesn't
            become a common thing among publishers.
