            Penny finally had her first big test of how good she will be as a
            companion dog.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's had some brief interactions with people while we walk the
            trails, but not as much as she would have had during a normal
            camping season. And she's had almost no interaction with other dogs,
            other than her brothers. So I've been worried.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of August, there was a local event called the Corgi
            Benefit Bash, and we took Penny.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were SO many people and dogs. Penny handled the whole thing
            like a champ. She had one little dog repeatedly take the play
            position and punch her in the face. No issues. She had other dogs
            sniff her from head to toes. No issues. She even had a dog try to
            pee on her. The only issue was that she drew back and gave him a
            look like, "DUDE!?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only did she have no issues with the dogs, or the people
            stopping to give her pets, she would sit quietly and watch everyone
            while hubby and I stopped to talk to people. No whining, no
            hissyfits!
          </p>
          <p>She's going to be a great companion dog!</p>

          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            Responses to last month's submission have been slow coming in, so it
            is the only story I have out right now. I'm not going to send out
            another one until I hear back from all the publishers on this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished a first rough draft of the new "nostalgia" story, though
            I'm still not sure I like the ending. I'm going to let it sit for a
            couple of weeks, and then I will come back to it and start revising.
            Maybe a better ending for it will manifest in the meantime.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have started on another idea, but it is still too much in the
            early stages to really talk about. I'm going to explore the idea and
            see if it develops into anything that might make it worthwhile to
            take to rough draft stage or if it peters out before becoming
            anything worthwhile.

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>

          <p>
            I finished <cite>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</cite>, by Becky
            Chambers, and it was good. It was the most hopeful depressing ending
            I've ever seen, but I enjoyed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't finish Heinlein's <cite>Stranger in a Strange Land</cite>.
            I thought it was awful pretty much from the beginning, and I was
            ready to abandon it several times. But then I'd tell myself to just
            keep pushing through, it will get better.
          </p>
          <p>
            It did NOT, in fact, get better. It actually got worse, which left
            me gobsmacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make no beans about the two movies that I consider the worst
            movies I've ever seen in my life: <cite>Mystery Men</cite> and
            <cite>Watchmen</cite>. Now I have a worst <em>book</em> I've ever
            read in my life (or, mostly read?). There's a certain horror author
            (who says he's NOT a horror author, and I agree, lol) who's work I
            really hate...and this Heinlein book is worse than that, in my
            opinion!
          </p>
          <p>
            The book took a very weird turn at the last third. I couldn't get
            past the fact that suddenly Jill decided to abandon the newspaper
            dude she "loved" and run off with the Mars Man while he "made his
            way as a man in the world." And then the next scenes have he and
            Jill working as a magician and magician's assistant in a sideshow,
            and they are having a threesome with the tattooed lady, and Jill
            lets the Man from Mars have sex with whoever he wants because she
            doesn't want to deprive the world of the experience...this book is
            seems like it was written by an incel living out all his fantasies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind, I'm no puritan, so that's not what bothers me. What
            bothers me is that this all has nothing to do with the effing story,
            you know? The first encounters in the story where the man from Mars
            was exploring sexuality make sense for the story. He's new to human
            "interactions" and wants to explore. But this later stuff is
            completely pointless for the story. If this book were billed as old
            fashioned erotica, fine, it would make sense. But this book is
            billed as foundational scifi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The funny thing is, if you go online, there are still a lot of
            people who say the book is the greatest and that haters just don't
            get it. I'd love to see the demographics on who is a diehard fan.
            I'm sure a lot of them are people who first read the book as teens,
            and it was one of their first forays into science fiction, so it
            sort of has that "sacred documents" status. And that's fine, I
            totally get it. I have lots of books (and movies) that I'm that way
            about, too. They were "landmark media" in my youth, so they still
            hold a special place in my heart, even though they suck now. These
            are the media that I usually try not to revisit so I don't ruin the
            memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <cite>Damnation Alley</cite>, I'm looking at you, lol. I thought
            that was the coolest movie ever. And then when I finally found a DVD
            copy just a few years ago and rewatched it, I was SO disappointed. I
            still love the movie, even though I acknowledge that it really is
            TERRIBLE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, now I'm reading <cite>Mirrored Heavens</cite>, by Rebecca
            Roanhorse, for my main book club, and
            <cite>The Picture of Dorian Gray</cite>, by Oscar Wilde, for the
            secondary book club. I still have never attended the second book
            club, since the most recent two meetings were about the Heinlen
            book, so I'm looking forward to finally going and seeing how it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also started reading a borrowed book, <cite>Mordew</cite>, by
            Alex Pheby. I read an excerpt, and I can't wait to get more into the
            story. There's living mud that "makes" creatures!
          </p>
          <p>
            So it's going to be a busy month of reading. That's fine, because
            the weather this month can be iffy. We are having a cold front this
            week, it it really feels like late fall. If it keeps this up, then
            it will be the pefect time to curl up with a book indoors!

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>

          <p>
            I am SO excited for my university class this semester. The textbook
            issue was resolved (no textbook, only supplemental materials). And
            it looks like it is going to be fascinating!
          </p>

          <p>
            It's focusing on the impact of technology on society, something I've
            been very interested in these last few years, starting with how
            social media has impacted everyone. And now we have all the hubbub
            over AI. AI is either going to be the downfall of civilization, or
            the savior, depending on who you talk to!
          </p>
          <p>
            The president of our university has declared a goal of making our
            university the "AI university for our state" (just as we are the UAS
            university for our state). So upper leadership in the university is
            embracing the power of AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            At other levels within the U, I know the feelings about AI are
            mixed, especially when it comes to how AI impacts teaching and
            learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supposedly, AI is gutting the computer programming industry and
            people are being laid off left and right. Why? I don't understand.
            You still need people to program and train AI. It's really just
            software and databases, after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then there are all the reports of people having problems
            distinguishing the reality of AI. From the man who thought he'd
            solved an impossible mathematical problem due AI's misleading
            encouragement of his ideas, to the boy who committed suicide after
            lengthy interactions with AI, people are having problems grasping
            that the interactions aren't real.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's fascinating, because just like our phones learn how we use them
            and respond/adjust accordingly, and even our cars learn how we drive
            them, AI learns how we use it and adjusts accordingly. I use AI
            regularly for work and personal use, and it has "adapted" to how it
            should interact with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first started using it, I would end our conversations by
            thanking it, etc. My joke was, "I want to be in good with our
            robotic overlords when they take over." And so my AI learned to be
            humorous with me. So now, even when I search for "What proteins make
            up XXX," It comes back with an answer and it ends it with, "May the
            proteins be ever in your favor."
          </p>

              alt="A screenshot of a response from AI"

            />
            <figcaption class="centered">
              When I was asking AI about Lovecraft's fiction
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            We were talking about the boy who committed suicide at work, and the
            article we were discussing referred to a company that does
            companions. I thought the company had went out of business. They
            used to do ads in all the phone games, and they were full of sketchy
            anime-style girls that would be your digital girlfriend. You were
            supposed to be able to "build" your dream "friend." It really felt
            like a whole online-sugarbaby thing. I haven't seen any ads in a
            while, so I thought they had gone out of business.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, maybe they aren't advertising anymore because they
            may not have to. It looks like they are doing well. They are still
            in business, and now they are billing themselves as, "Your AI
            companion," and they have a slick, nicely designed website (as
            opposed to the sketchy, half-ass ads they used to run games).
          </p>
          <p>
            I think one of my coworkers was traumatized by this new knowledge,
            lol. Out of curiosity, she googled them (that's how we found out
            about their slick website). She decided to check out the reviews
            they have on the site, and the reviews said things like,
            <em
              >"We've been together four years, and I've never been happier!"
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Review after review, they were all the same: people acting as if
            their "AI companion" was a real relationship. Not surprising, given
            how people have been interacting with just the plain-interface AI of
            CoPilot and ChatGPT.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it probably makes it easier to pretend it's real when
            you've designed your "AI companion" to look like the House Bunny.
            &#128514;
          </p>
          <p>
            And that seems to be the norm for the site. The profile pic of the
            reviewer would be a middle-aged, fat, balding man, and the review
            would include a graphic of the House Bunny girlfriend that he
            created for himself and was so happy with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why not, I guess? If you're going to pretend, why not go all out,
            right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, humans interacting with technology is fascinating to me, as
            you can tell from how long this section became. Don't even get me
            started on TikTok!
          </p>
          <p>
            So, yes! I am very much looking forward to this university class!
          </p>
          <p>
            And I'm still working on my other stuff: Spanish through Duolingo
            and Udemy, Codecademy, Javascript, etc. At a minimum, I get at least
            one Duolingo lesson and one Codecademy lesson done daily.

          <h5>This month's pondering/share/rant.</h5>

          <p>I'm dabbling in a new hobby.</p>
          <p>
            Turtle River State Park had a great artist-in-residence session with
            an artist who does leathertooling. Leathertooling involves stamping
            or carving a design into leather.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://www.leatherneo.com/blogs/news-and-stories/tooling-leather-everything-you-need-to-know?srsltid=AfmBOorSLj0xB_YpUr_A8UPsH-uJHCk5vZwCOOcUP8TEnbvI5v8LlQPT"

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The session with the artist in residence was so much fun, and the
            work so relaxing (I was completely absorbed in it), that I decided
            to give it a try at home. I'm not very good yet, but I'm learning. I
            was absolutely thrilled when I heard that a lot of people use
            watercolors on their designs (Yay! That's my jam!), so I decided to
            try some of my Dr. Ph. Bombay India ink (iridescent) on a design.

            <figcaption class="centered">Projects I'm working on</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            My linework and beveling still needs a lot of work, but the India
            ink looks terrific! With more practice, I eventually hope to expand
            into leatherworking, as well, and make my own custom purse and a new
            gun sling. Of course, a leathertooled Cthulhu Fhtagn r'lyeh runes
            belt isn't out of the question, either (and yes, I did think of that
            when I was making my first floral project, shown in the picture, and
            I was thinking, "Wow, these leaves would make GREAT
            tentacles!")&#128514;
