            Oh my gosh. Anyone else feel like January was 4325 days long?
            Seriously! January stuck around so long that I actually got used to
            writing "2025" on everything!
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we aren't out of the woods yet for cold weather, this month
            brings a lot of hope. The days are getting longer, camping
            reservations begin, and the UND Writers Conference is right around
            the corner. In fact, the community events start this month as part
            of the lead-up to the conference!
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't complain too much about this winter, though. We haven't had
            a lot -20s (or worse) like we've had in the past. The picture at the
            top of the post was one of the few very cold days where sundogs were
            present. As we were driving, the angle was perfect to snap a picture
            of a sundog lighting up that tree.

          <h5>Writing update</h5>
          <p>Still struggling, but making progress!</p>
          <p>
            I'm still trying to work on my big nonfiction project, but it's a
            slow go. Though I do wish I could progress a little faster with it,
            it's an independent project, and can't be rushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of January, I decided I was going to try to resurrect my
            creative processes by doing the Writer's Digest February Flash
            Fiction Challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried a couple of challenges--most notably, the poetry
            challenge that ran most of last year. I "kept up with" for all of a
            week or two!
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it's still too early to tell, the flash fiction challenge has
            actually worked out better than I thought. I didn't write anything
            for day 1, though I might circle back to the prompt.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then on day 2, I read the prompt and thought, "Wow. I like that.
            I think I can write something for that." I went about my day to let
            the prompt percolate, and headed off to the first of the Writers
            Conference Community Events.
          </p>
          <p>
            And my creativty was sparked enough that, after the workshop, I came
            home and wrote a short piece of fiction!
          </p>
          <p>I'm ecstatic!</p>
          <p>
            I'm going to try and get it finished and edited during this
            "creative time" of the workshops and the writers conference so I
            don't lose my momentum with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I have the workshop to thank for it. When I go to these writer
            events (these workshops, the Writers Conference, my local writers
            group), it always energizes and inspires me. And every time, I say,
            "Why don't I do this more?!" Seriously, it's been well over a year
            since I went to my local writer's group, and they meet twice a
            month!
          </p>
          <p>
            So I am once again telling myself, "Me! Listen up. Let's keep the
            inspiration and creative energy going! Go to all the workshops in
            February! Go to all the events at the UND Writers Conference. And
            for the love of all that is holy, reconnect with and start attending
            your local writers group! For you own good!"
          </p>
          <p>
            And I'm not going to put any pressure on myself with this new story.
            I'm going to work on it and see what happens. If it goes in a
            drawer, fine. If it becomes the first new story I've finished and
            submitted in way-too-long, that's awesome. We will just have to see
            where it goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            And today, on day 3, I wrote another story, though this one is more
            bare-bones than the other and will need more work to finish. But
            still...it's writing!

          <h5>Reading Update</h5>
          <p>
            I started Erdrich's The Nightwatchman, but I haven't made enough
            progress in it. I want to go to the bookclub at the end of the
            month, so I have to get started on reading Erdrich's The Mighty Red.
            The bookclub meets at the end of the month!
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to usual course of business, I have NOT bought and read any
            of the books from the Writers Conference authors. It's no reflection
            on the authors, just the progression of my own experience. Every
            year, I buy ALL the books, adding to my ridiculously large "to be
            read" stack (which I have no hopes of finishing unless I live to be
            5000 years old). And then I go to the conference and discover that,
            while I always enjoy the discussion an author brings to the
            conference, their book might not be my cup of tea. Sometimes, it's
            not only not my cup of tea, but it's on a whole different planet
            from the things I enjoy reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't get me wrong; it's still great to support the author by
            purchasing their work. But when you combine my limited time to read
            stuff plus my budget for buying books (which I'm TRYING to be more
            responsible about, lol), it just doesn't make sense to buy ALL the
            books.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this year, I'm going to take a more responsible course of action.
            I'm going to attend the conference and purchase the works that speak
            to me as a reader.

          <h5>What I'm watching this month</h5>
          <p>
            I haven't had a lot of time to watch anything other than my regular
            shows (Survivor, when it's in season; All the 90-Day Fiance flavors;
            and Sister Wives). Even when I do watch, the TV is usually on in the
            background while I'm working at something else (painting,
            programming, chores, etc.)
          </p>

          src="./images/NewestBar.png"

          <h5>Classes Update</h5>
          <p>
            I am continuing learning Java through Udemy, and I'm getting pretty
            good at it. My computer science class was a struggle, but it did
            remind me how much I love programming, and helped me fall in love
            with Java.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would really love to pursue a computer science major (how many
            times have I said that, right?), but I have the same issue that I
            did the first time: all the math and science, lol. Except now I'm
            112 years old and the math and science is even harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I do understand the reasoning for all the extra stuff required
            for the degree. You have to take all the crazy, in-depth math
            because that might be what you end up using your programming skills
            for. And you have to take all the electrical engineering courses
            because that might be part of what you end up doing if you get a job
            in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            I rememer my first computer job. I was doing QA and testing for the
            programming department, which also involved writing scripts to test
            the software. It was such a small company, we were expected to do
            our own computer upgrades. So if I needed to network several
            computers to run tests, that was on me. If I needed to install extra
            RAM or a bigger hard drive, that was on me. So I understand the
            "extras" that are required for a programming degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            But gosh darn it! I just wanted to write code then, and I just want
            to write code now!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still working through the full-stack developer course at
            Codecademy. I'm in the Javascript section, which is awesome! A lot
            of the syntax is much like the Java I'm learning, so it's pretty
            easy (so far).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still learning Spanish through Duolingo, and I've added a
            different Spanish course in Skillshare. I like it, because it's
            giving explanations for things, which is something Duolingo falls
            short on (more on that in a later section).
          </p>
          <p>I've also added "Dreaming Spanish" to my lesson list.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.dreamingspanish.com" target="_blank"
              >Dreaming Spanish</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Dreaming Spanish is a good site for practicing your Spanish because
            it is a series of fun little videos about different things like
            playing "spot the difference" between two photos, or "which
            celebrity is older," etc. But the phrases are spoken very slowly,
            with charade-like hand gestures at times, and repeated, so they are
            easier for Spanish-learners to follow.

          <h5>Duolingo Review</h5>
          <p>
            I've been using Duolingo for almost a year now, so I think I'm ready
            to give a full and comprehensive review.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if you are a “TL;DR” person: I like Duolingo, in spite of its
            problems, and will continue to use it. But I recommend using
            Duolingo in tandem with another language-learning app because
            Duolingo's strength is in practice and repeition, not instruction.
          </p>
          <p>Now, on to the full review.</p>
          <p>
            Almost from the moment I started using Duo, I was getting ads in my
            feeds from its competitors referring to Duo as an abusive
            relationship. I thought that was ridiculous, but as I continued
            using the program, I began to understand some of what they meant.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to use the app just because I wanted to casually learn
            Spanish. And at first, it was fun. It was fun to see that I was
            keeping a streak of practicing every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are all kinds of challenges you can participate in, though I
            generally don't. Like I said, I just want to have fun and learn
            Spanish. The one thing I did find myhself roped into was the levels,
            though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't even realize that there were levels when I first started
            using it. But then I completed "X" amount of lessons and got the
            notification that I moved up to the Silver League.” Then, after more
            lessons, I moved up to Gold League. Pretty soon, I was paying
            attention! I started trying to make sure I moved up a league every
            week. And at first, it was easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the lessons started getting harder, and it was requiring more
            and more points to move up. Instead of completing two lessons a day
            to move up, it was five, and then six.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then pretty soon, I couldn't keep up with progressing to the
            next league, even doing the same number of daily lessons. I went
            from trying to move up to just trying to make sure I stayed out of
            the “Demotion Zone” for my league so I didn't drop down a level.
          </p>
          <p>
            One Saturday, even after completing 2-5 lessons every day for the
            whole week, I had to spend an hour and a half on the app to “catch
            up my points” so I wouldn't drop down a level and fall out of my
            current league.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, learning Spanish wasn't fun anymore. It was an actual
            chore!
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at the scores for next week and did the math: I'd have to
            get at least 200 points a day to stay in my league. Except for times
            when you win a 2x boost, most lessons are 10 to 20 points per
            lesson, with each lesson requiring around 15 translations. I don't
            have time to spend an hour a day on Duolingo. The whole point of
            this was supposed to be “in just three minutes a day, you can learn
            Spanish.”
          </p>
          <p>
            NOW I understand why one of the guys I follow has been using the app
            for ELEVEN YEARS and is still several levels below my level. He's
            been using the app long enough to not buy into the level trap.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I've stopped chasing levels. I don't care if I drop all the way
            back down to Bronze level. I'm just going to go back to a lesson or
            two every day and have fun with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start, one of the big problems with learning through
            Duolingo is that there is almost no instruction. You are just
            introduced to words, and then gradually put those words in
            sentences. Occasionally, a "here's a grammar tip, how to conjugate
            ir verbs" will pop up, but it's usually after you've been struggling
            to conjugate them for the last month or so.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I run into a lot of problems where I feel like I've learned from
            repetition that a sentence should be structured in one way (or a
            verb conjugated in a certain way), and then suddenly it changes and
            now the app is showing me to do it this other way. And I'm left
            wondering why? Why is it different this time around? And then I have
            to go Google it and try and figure it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think Duolingo could benefit from a bit more instruction. As it
            is, it is very much a "language practice app" and not a "language
            learning app," in my opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another problem with Duolingo is that it could improve the learning
            process by using sentences where you are able to figure things out
            based on context. For example, I was doing an exercise where the app
            spoke a sentence. There was no word bank to choose from, just an
            audio sentence and a blank text box for me to type in what I thought
            I heard. I couldn't quite make out what one of the words was. I
            figured out all the rest of the sentence: “Yo (blank) cuando ella
            dijo eso” = I did (some verb) when she said that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay. So what's the missing word? I tried to gain some context and
            re-listened, including in slowed speed, three times. I still
            couldn't make out the missing word. I finally just decided to get it
            wrong and typed in phonetically what I thought the speaker was
            saying.
          </p>
          <p>Nope. Got it wrong.</p>
          <p>
            The word was "manejaba." So the sentence was, "I DROVE when she said
            that."
          </p>
          <p>Ummm. Wow. I would have never guessed that in a million years.</p>
          <p>
            All it would have taken was for the sentence to have more context,
            something like, "Yo (blank) el coche cuando ella dijo eso" (I blank
            the car when she said that) and it would have moved this out of the
            "that's so strange and frustrating" column (which creates learning
            walls) and into the the "learning and understanding" column!
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of the problems I will continue to use Duo because I have
            learned a lot and (generally) enjoy the app. I do recommend the app
            if you are interested in learning a language, but I also recommend
            learning through another app or program in tandem.
