            Beware the Ides of March . . . where riding high after a wonderful

            I have really been missing my mice (the mice I took care of in my
            previous job in the vivarium). If you follow me on Facebook, you
            know my feed is full of mice and rats (and corgis, of course).
            Lately, I've also been getting a lot of hamster related videos and
            memes.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the last night of the Writers Conference, when I was in
            soaring spirits from the literary immersion, hubby had to run to the
            pet shop to get some plants for the aquariums. And, the pet shop was
            having a sale on hamsters.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is just the cutest little thing, and so very chill. He doesn't
            seem bothered by handling, corgis, or the noise of my office, which
            is where I put his cage (so he has lots of social "interaction" and
            household activity.)
          </p>
          <p>
            We've only had him a short time, so we will see how it goes, but it
            seems like this chill little hamster is going to fit into our family
            just perfectly.

          <p>
            As you can see, I've updated the website using some of the new
            skills I've learned in my class. I think it's really improved it
            beyond my old basic design. This is bringing me closer to ditching
            Wordpress altogether and having a stand-alone HTML site again. Woot!
          </p>
          <p>
            The sidebar is still a learning area. Eventually, it will have
            social media widgets, a link for rss feed, and all that good stuff.
            For now, I haven't learned any of that, so it's just mostly empty
            real estate.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's kind of cool to be doing this more robustly. Back in the day,
            when I first learned html (before CSS was even a thing, really), we
            used to trick out our websites like a computer-nerd version of "pimp
            my ride." Back then, I created our homeschooling website from
            scratch, and it had active/shifting backgrounds, auto-play music for
            every page, blinkies, cursor effects . . . everyone's sites look
            like they had been designed by Liberace. Long before MySpace, there
            was the glory known as Geo-Cities, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, of course, we know better than to go so overboard. I don't even
            bother adding music anymore because it is SO annoying to visit a
            site and suddenly have music playing (or, more common today, a damn
            video that autoplays). But that doesn't mean a Cthulhu cursor might
            not be in the future for this site. Small embellishments, you know?
            Nothing over-the-top . . . nothing TOO over-the-top, anyway, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, that's a bit down the road. Right now, my link buttons in
            the sidebar are fugly because I need to add widgets but don't know
            how to make the javascript work . . . yet. So until I do, I've got
            these terrible looking buttons and such over there as placeholders.
            Don't worry, I'm hoping to be able to move past them in a month or
            two.

          <p>
            My writing update this time starts with the UND Writers Conference.
            It was amazing, as always. This was Dr. Crystal Albert's last year
            running the conference, and she really ended with a great one!
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from great panels and readings, the workshops this year were
            incredible. In the first workshop, with Ava Chin, her focus was on
            the question, “Why I write.” She had essays from George Orwell and
            Joan Didion where they ponder that very question. It really got me
            thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've really been struggling with writer's block (THREE YEARS!!!),
            and my self-dialogue/thought process about it has been "I want to
            write. Why can't I write?!" The two may be tied together, but not in
            the way I've been coming at it. Maybe the question shouldn't be,
            "Why can't I write," but "Why do I want to write?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, Ava Chin upped the ante and said we should ask the same
            question of our younger selves. When we were younger, why did we
            write? Why was it something so important to us back then? The
            premise in Orwell's essay was that if we stray to far from those
            original reasons, we get in our own way and likely create problems.
            We 'lose' ourselves. Our writer selves.
          </p>
          <p>Well . . . son-of-a-bitch.</p>
          <p>
            The best answer I could come up with for Why I Write (or why I
            continue to flog myself over not writing and am trying so damn
            desperately to get back to it) was:
          </p>
          <p>Because I always have.</p>
          <p>That's not much of a reason!</p>
          <p>
            As for my younger self, I wanted to share stories. I loved reading
            and I wanted to share the stories in my imagination. I wanted to
            make people happy, sad, scared; I wanted to make them think. I
            wanted to give readers the adventures and emotions that I got out of
            stories. And writing was just plain old fun! I was always a pantser,
            so I would start with an idea and just see where it went. And that
            was fun! "Being a writer" was something I wanted for so long. I was
            so thrilled when I was able to start doing it regularly, and even
            more thrilled when I was actually published. Even before I was
            published, it was a big part of how I identified myself: I am a
            writer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first story I ever *remember* writing was in 6th grade. I took
            first place at the young author's conference. I think the story had
            something to do with rabbits (I had read Watership Down two years
            earlier.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay. So I started out wanting to share stories, and "writer" has
            always been a big part of my identity. But why am I still trying to
            write NOW?
          </p>
          <p>
            Am I trying to be something I just no longer am? Just because
            "writer" WAS a big part of my identity, it doesn't mean that is who
            I am now. Have I just lost my way? Or I have I cracked out of a
            shell that, like it or not, I've outgrown?
          </p>
          <p>
            Day one, event number 2 of the UND Writer's Conference, and I'm
            having a damn existential crisis. &#60;Sticks head in brown paper
            bag and hyperventilates.&#62;
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of it, when I go back through my old blogs and see areas
            where I'm having problems writing (either writer's block or just a
            general apathy) one of the things I always mention is that, "I need
            to make it fun again. I've been taking publishing/getting
            paid/making deadlines/or whatever far too seriously, and it's taken
            the fun out. I'm going to write poetry/limericks/not write to
            submission calls/etc. to try and get back to the fun and joy of it."
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I've got to spend some time considering my why, and what I
            can really do to make it more fun again. Do I think it's an identity
            I've outgrown? Could be, but I don't think so. I think that the I've
            lost my way (my WHY). I think all my old blogs were right, and I've
            let the fun be sucked out of writing, and that's one of the biggest
            reasons I started writing in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been blaming my block mostly on some shit that went down in
            2021, but that was only the tip of a very large iceberg that had
            been undergoing accretion for a very long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I want to write again, then I need to find my "Why" and also make
            it fun again. How to do that? Pffff. Hell if I know.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I did end up having a really, REALLY great time in the
            poetry workshop and actually wrote three drafts of poems that might
            have merit! In only an hour!
          </p>

          <p>
            Terrance Hayes is not just a great poet, he's a great teacher, and
            he is super enthusiastic! He loves, loves, LOVES sharing poetry with
            people. Not just in reading it, but in writing it and helping THEM
            write it. Anytime someone is that enthusiastic, it's almost always
            contagious!

            I started reading Albert Camus's The Plague as prep for the UND
            Writers Conference, but I'm still working on it. AND, I still have
            two or three other books I'm working on, lol. My "TBR" (to-be-read)
            list just keeps growing longer, and I'm not making much progress
            against it!
          </p>
        </section>
        <img
          src="./images/NewestBar.png"

        <section id="education">
          <p>
            The only thing longer than my TBR list is my TBW list: To be
            watched. I'm thinking about doing some revisiting, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I happened to catch a few bits and pieces of Annihilation recently.
            The first time I watched it, I had been chomping at the bit for it
            to finally make it to a streaming service (or rental) where I could
            watch it, but it seemed like it was at least two years (if not
            longer) before it was released to streaming/rentals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe my anticipation for it was part of the problem, but when I
            watched it, it was a total letdown. It was pretty, but it kind of
            sucked. Especially that bear nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's be honest: cocaine bear (or the zombie bear in Z Nation) was
            scarier.
          </p>
          <p>
            But during my recent catching of bits and pieces of the movie, it
            hit different. I don't know why, but I was able to enjoy it more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same thing happened a few days ago with Prometheus. Ye, Gods!
            How I have hated that movie. But I caught a bit here and there, and
            it actually seemed to have more merit and be more interesting than
            my first viewing.
          </p>
          <p>So either:</p>
          <p>
            My expectations interfered with my first viewing of these movies, or
          </p>
          <p>
            These movies are better in small snippets and scenes rather than
            taken as a whole, or
          </p>
          <p>My tastes are getting duller?</p>
          <p>It will be interesting to see which might be the case.</p>
          <p>
            I KNOW I will still have problems with Prometheus and and Covenant,
            just because there are plot problems. What bunch of scientists are
            going to hop off on an alien planet and go, "Hey! The air is fine
            for supporting human respiration. Let's take off our masks without a
            single considertion to viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc." Or that whole
            ridiculous scene where the two guys encounter the swimming
            snake-like alien, and the guy decides to try and touch it? I don't
            care how high you are, you're still going to react to a snake-like
            thing as if it were a snake, especially something that's new and
            never seen before. So yeah. Parts of the plots are just eye-rolling
            ridiculous, but I'm still going to try and give them another watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, my plans for watching are always WAY bigger than what I
            actually accomplish, though (see my "plan" to rewatch Defiance from,
            oh, I don't know, at least a year or two ago, lol). So we will see
            how this goes and see if I actually rewatch any of these!
          </p>
          <p>
            I did Watch Aquaman 2. Okay, technically, I was on the couch
            cuddling with hubby and he decided to watch Aquaman 2, so I was just

            I'm not really a fan of superhero movies, but I am a big fan of
            Momoa, and not just because he's very easy on the eyes. In a lot of
            his movies, he just comes off as a big doof (even when he's a
            superhero). His characters always seem to have this thrill/joy of
            life that make them such a pleasure to watch. I'm sure that's the
            way they are written, but I also (from what I've seen in interviews
            etc.) think it might be part of his genuine personality filtering
            into the characters, and that's why it really translates well. It
            could all be an act, but if that's the case, then his acting cred
            goes up 10x for puling it off. He really does seem like a guy that
            would be a blast to hang out and have a few beers with.

          <p>
            I just finished another exam for web development class, and it was
            *almost* as much of a clusterf**k as the first one (groan).
          </p>
          <p>
            In anticipation of potential wi-fi issues, I purchased a mini
            docking station (the exam venue advises that you have a hardline to
            your internet connection rather than wi-fi, but NONE of my laptops
            have an ethernet port).
          </p>
          <p>
            I hooked up my laptop, set myself up on the futon in my office. The
            venue warns that you should be in a pristine, distraction free
            location, but my office is far from un-cluttered. Since it's full of
            books and papers, etc., I set up on the futon so that there are no
            concerns from the proctors about books/papers/notes being within
            arms reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything went smoothly until the proctor made their usual request
            of, "Show me the room." I picked up my laptop and begin to pan
            around the room, and then a window popped up on my computer stating
            that my connection is unstable. If you've ever used ethernet cords,
            you know how wonky they can be if they, or your computer, move a
            little.
          </p>
          <p>
            Panning my laptop caused the ethernet cord to wiggle and I lost my
            connection with the proctor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm already stressed because it's an exam AND because I had such
            problems with the prior exam (bad password from the instructor,
            etc.), so now I'm freaking out. To make matters worse, it's now 20
            minutes past my original log-in time for the exam. And the exam
            warns that if you log in more than fifteen minutes past your
            scheduled time, it will not accept it and you will have to
            reschedule. So will it count this log on as a new one, and make me
            reschedule, or will it capture that my new log on is just because of
            technical difficulties???
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, I'm wondering why I keep putting myself through this
            shit. I don't NEED to take these classes. I'm doing this for fun,
            and things like this are DEFINITELY NOT FUN and just superfluous
            stress!
          </p>
          <p>
            So I get logged on, and the program starts to connect me to a new
            procotor. But then my previous proctor closes that connection and
            restarts the process with me. Whew! But then he sounds all pissy
            with me, like it's MY fault the connection got lost. Whatever, dude.
            At this point, let's just get this ##@!$#@!$#@! exam over with.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I take the exam. It's meh. There seem to be a lot of questions
            that weren't in our materials and even a question or two where NONE
            of the answers are the right one (did the prof mis-type some of
            these?)
          </p>
          <p>
            So, once again, I'm stressed and just glad to be done with the damn
            thing. I go to the proctor window and . . . it's a totally different
            proctor now. Did my proctor have to take a pee break and have
            someone else take over? Okay, whatever. Let's roll with it. I type
            in the chat window, "Okay, I've submitted my exam. Anything else to
            do?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Proctor: "Your institution requires complete erasure of the
            whiteboard. Erase it completely and then hold it up to the camera
            for so I can see."
          </p>

          <p>Um. What? I type, "What whiteboard?"</p>
          <p>Proctor: "The writing materials."</p>
          <p>
            Me: "My institution doesn't allow any writing materials." I'm
            thinking, what the f are you talking about? I had to do the whole
            'pan the room' thing at the start of the exam to show that there
            were no writing materials, books, papers, cellphone, people, etc.
            anywhere near me! Moreso, I'm thinking, "Bitch, did you see me
            writing on anything? NO. So what are you talking about with this
            whiteboard business???"
          </p>
          <p>
            She responds, "Alright. Have a good night!" and we disconnect.
            However, that doesn't resolve my stress, because now I'm thinking,
            what if the professor gets a transcript of this shit? He might end
            up thinking I was pulling one over on the proctor with a whiteboard
            when there was no whiteboard involved!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sigh. These classes are supposed to be for my own fun and enjoyment,
            and they really haven't been since I left the English department.
            They've actually been getting progressively worse. Maybe it's just
            because I haven't taken any communication department classes for a
            while, and all my classes have been in the college of business.
            Maybe the college of business is just not for me, not even as a
            minor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I got a B on the exam, which normally would not even be
            remotely acceptable, but given all the stress and issues I've had
            with the exams/ProctorU Live, it's actually freaking fabulous. That
            I haven't completely failed these high stress situations is pretty
            amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class itself? Still love it. I've learned SO much. It really has
            been valuable. But the whole Proctor U thing (required by the
            college of business) has been a thorn in my side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from my UND Web Development class, I am also working on
            learning Spanish through one of my online learning platforms (and
            these classes ARE, in fact, VERY FUN!).
          </p>
          <p>
            Quiero dos cervezas, por favor. Un para m&#237;, y un para ella.
          </p>
          <p>Para m&#237;, la comida es perfecta aqu&#237;.</p>
          <p>Eso es delicioso, pero no es muy bueno para m&#237;.</p>
          <p>
            As you can tell, I'm in the early stages, but I'm learning to hold
            my own ordering in a restaurant!
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember that my first lessons in French (way back in high school)
            were the same way. We started with learning the words for food,
            drink, and ordering in restaurants, then moved on to very important
            phrases like, "Ou est la salle de bain?" Hopefully, I'll learn it in
            Spanish soon, too, and soon be able to ask where the bathroom is in
            THREE languages, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest issue with learning Spanish is that the years of French I
            took are interfering with it a bit. When you say an 'r' sound in
            French, it's usually a "back of the throat, choking on a chip"
            sound. In Spanish, those are supposed to be rolled. So where
            "terrible" in French is sort of te-chk-ree-blay, it is
            tearrrrrree-blay, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I'd like to get pretty good at Spanish, and then I will take
            a refresher on French. I used to be able to read, write, and hold
            conversations in French very well, but now I'm rusty.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I'm doing this mostly for fun, being fairly fluent in those
            three languages (English, French, Spanish) mean I can hold
            conversations with a huge number of people, which is pretty awesome.
            If I wanted to REALLY be able to interact with a large number of
            people, I could learn Mandarin. In almost all language lists, it is
            listed in the top 3 most-spoken languages. However, Mandarin is very
            difficult, and I'm not sure how well I would do with the tonal
            differences so important to communicating in Mandarin. So I'm going
            to stick with the easier languages for now.

        <section id="pondering">
          <p>This month's "pondering or rant" is a little bit of a rant.</p>
          <p>
            If you remember, I had sent an email to an advisor to inquire about
            possibly changing my major. I hadn't heard anything back after a
            month and was planning on sending another email just in case my
            original one got lost in the shuffle or in a pile of email if the
            advisor had been sick or on vacation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it also almost time to register for classes, I decided to pop
            into our class management app and take a look at potential classes
            for next semester before I sent the new email. For reasons I'm not
            quite sure of, I also popped into our app's “What-if” section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The software has a function that allows you to create “What-if”
            scenarios before you change your major. It basically compares your
            transcript with the degree requirements and lets you know which
            classes you are missing and which classes you have already taken.
            It's a great tool. However, it has two problems:
          </p>
          <ol class="generalOL">
            <li>
              It doesn't always catch “close-enough” classes or number changes.
              For example, I took Fundamentals of Public Speaking a million
              years ago when it was Comm 161. Now, the course has the same name
              but is Comm 110. It doesn't always catch these and mark the
              requirement as completed.
            </li>
            <li>
              It must not work after you've complete a degree. I haven't been
              able to make it do a “what-if” since I earned my English degree.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            So, for whatever reason, I popped into the What-if section of the
            app, and what do you know? There was a "requested what-if report" in
            there with a date of about a week after I contacted the advisor!
          </p>
          <p>
            Cool beans! The advisor must have created the report for me and just
            forgot to send me an email about it (trust me, it happens. I've done
            it myself more than once!).
          </p>
          <p>
            But . . . upon further investigation, I'm unsure about the accuracy
            of the report.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the sections it says I'm missing is in Essential Studies,
            those base classes every student has to take before their major
            courses. Okay, I get that. I'm sure it's a thing of the course
            catalog has changed, and so they've changed the ES requirements. My
            current major has me "grandfathered-in" to the old ES requirements.
            If I change my major, I will have to comply with the new ES
            requirements. I get that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amusing part? The ES I would be missing is in the category of .
            . . drum roll . . . communication! Communication just happens to be
            my current major, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, aside from just being amusing, you can see from this list
            of courses that would fulfill this ES requirement why I mentioned
            how changing class numbers over time can create a problem. This area
            of ES requires 3 credits.
          </p>
          <a
            href="https://und-public.courseleaf.com/undergraduateacademicinformation/essentialstudies/communication/"
            target="_blank"
            >Communication ES</a
          >
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Now you see why I mentioned Comm 161 in the intro. I've already
            taken the the three-credit fundamentals of public speaking course
            that should fulfill this requirement, just under another number. In
            addition, I've also taken CSCI 289, Social Implications of Computer
            Technology. However, when I took the class, it was a two credit
            course. Now it is a three credit course. The What-If report picked
            up the class, but it has it listed as it's original two-credit
            course . . . leaving me ONE credit short on this ES area, lol.
          </p>

            Normally, the advisors "clean-up" these kinds of issues and correct
            the report. So, I will have to send another email to the advisor
            asking for clarification on these.

            But it looks like no matter what, I would end up having to take
            Calculus I, II, and linear algebra (ick). And Electrical Engineering
            Introduction to Digital Electronics with lab. And a statistical math
            course (gross), and another laboratory science (meteorology fulfills
            that, which I'm okay with).
          </p>

            I could just declare a Computer Science minor. I have fulfilled the
            requirements for that already with classes I took in the past
            (except for the ES issue, of course; I might still have to resolve
            some of that).
          </p>

            So I'm not any closer on figuring out which way I'm going to go. I
            don't know if I want to deal with the experience requirement of my
            current communication major, but I don't know if I can handle all
            the math for the computer science major. It's a conundrum.
          </p>

            My plan for registering for classes is that I am not taking a summer
            class. I'm going to concentrate on (fingers crossed) writing,
            painting, and fun classes on Udemy. In the fall, I'm going to take a
            class outside of my major (Communication; college of Arts and
            Sciences) and outside of my minor (Management Information Systems;
            college of business). I'm going to take a programming class in the
            computer science department (College of Engineering and Mines) and
            see how I feel about it.
          </p>

            Side note: many years ago, practically in the days of DOS, I was a
            computer science major. And I don't remember it being part of the
            college of engineering and mines. I'm guessing that's something that
            happened as part of the restructuring and shuffling that goes on in
            departments in academia.
