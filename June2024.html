        <section id="intro">
          <p>
            I celebrated a milestone last month at my day job. I got my "Ten
            Years of Service" certificate from the University. Technically I've
            been there twelve years, but they don't count those first two years
            because I was classified as a part-time, temporary employee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twelve years ago, Hubby's rotating shift job was burning him out. He
            wanted to try some other jobs that had better hours at his
            workplace, and, of course, those jobs paid less. So I took a
            part-time job in the clean room at the vivarium to make up some of
            the wage difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I helped out a few times when staff was short, and I fell in
            love with the mice. That made me decide to leave the clean side job
            and become a full-time animal tech. I worked as an animal tech for
            about eight years.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, as often happens, things change. The job added an "on call"
            component, and I hate that. I'm one of those "when I leave work, I
            LEAVE work" people. I made my feelings about it clear, and waited a
            bit to see if anyone was going to resolve the problem, but they
            didn't. So I had to find another job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, a position as the Research Compliance Coordinator
            opened up at the university, and I was hired for that. I still get
            to work within the animal care program, so, in a way, I'm still
            taking care of my mice, just not hands-on anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            So from that little part-time job has grown a ten-year (so far)
            career. And I have no intention of retiring anytime soon, so we will
            see how many "X Years of Service" certificates I end up earning!
          </p>
          <p>
            And Hubby's search for a position within his company with better
            hours? It worked out in the end, but not the way you might think. He
            tried several different jobs and didn't like any of them. So he went
            back to his rotating shift job, which was where his heart was.
            Luckily, the dropped the rotating part of the job not long after.
            They were having problems getting those positions filled (besides
            hubby's) and thought the rotating might have something to do with it
            (go figure).

        <section id="writing">
          <p>
            This month's writing update is that there has been a ton of writing
            going on this year, and I just didn't realize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Granted, a lot of the writing has been technical writing. I've been
            creating a lot of tip sheets at work and am currently working on a
            big user manual for the protocol process. But I've also done a lot
            of opinion pieces! They tend to start out as just me sitting down to
            journal, but they quickly turn into 1500 word op-ed pieces like
            you'd see in the Times. Come to think of it, maybe I need to start
            trying to submit some of these.
          </p>
          <p>
            So while there is little-to-no horror writing going on, there IS a
            lot of writing going on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of which . . . I normally post a goals check-in this time
            of year, but I'm not doing that this year. The goals are how they
            always are: hit and miss. Some months I do great, and then months go
            by without any progress. So I'm in a “eff goals” mood and not going
            to bother. We will see how I feel about goals in December.

            My reading has fallen by the wayside lately, too, at least for the

            On a related note, the cover of this book is a good reason to not
            use stock templates. Here are two audiobooks I recently purchased.

            As you can see, they both used the same cover template and then just
            customized it a bit from there. It must have something to do with
            Audible or audio formats, though, because both "books" have
            different covers in paperback. I have no idea why, though, as I've
            never published a book and had it converted to audio format.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not a fan of too-similar covers, generally, because I often
            recognize a book by it's cover rather than its title. It's not as
            big of a deal with audiobooks, though, since the Audible app does
            keep track of what you listen to, so there's little to no risk of me
            buying a book I've already listened to. Believe me, it's happened
            with dead tree books.

          <p>
            Since I'm not taking a university course over the summer, I've been
            focusing on some of my other independent-learning projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still working on my Udemy HTML course and studying spanish. I've
            also added in a "studying paganism" component (hence the books
            above). So I've got five little notebooks on the corner of my desk
            that I work in and take with me when we camp:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spanish</li>
            <li>HTML notes</li>
            <li>Pagan notes</li>
            <li>Journal</li>
            <li>Writing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some days, I just work in one. Some days, I work in all of them. I
            just shift between each one as I get bored. Not only is it a good
            way to spend my time more wisely (instead of scrolling through my
            phone or playing on my apps), it's also a good way to finally start
            using up some of these notebooks I've been hoarding for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seriously, what is with us writers? Almost every writer I know
            either has a hoard of notebooks or they have "special notebooks"
            that they've bought but are saving and never use. I'm firmly in the
            "every year, buy them by the case from Walmart during school supply
            season."
          </p>
          <p>
            And to clarify the difference between "Journal" and "Writing,"
            "Writing" is where I do my typical kind of fiction writing: story
            ideas, scenes, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Journaling" is actually a class I'm also taking at Udemy. It has
            exercises and such, so I keep a journal notebook for that class
            separate from my "usual" writing.

            With all this going on, plus the journaling/essaying and
            summer-related house stuff, it was the art's turn to fall off the
            schedule. I'm pretty sure I haven't painted in almost a month. I
            think the last time I painted was the night of my final, when I was
            trying to de-stress!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm hoping that camping season will give me more opportunities to
            pick the art back up.

            Circling back to "maybe camping will give me more time to art," the
            first camping trip of the year is this month's rant.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Camping Opener" is usually the Friday leading up to Memorial Day
            Monday. This year, it rained all day opening day. Not thunderstorms,
            just a constant pouring rain. And 45 degrees with a 40 mph wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 5 pm, the temperature was 34 degrees and the wind chill was 20.
            The rain turned to freezing rain, then snow. We had the heater AND
            the fireplace going! At Metigoshe, a park north of us, they got 4+
            inches of snow for the camping opener.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dogs were all bummed because we were trapped inside. Murphy was
            so bummed he actually started watching PBS.
          </p>
          <p>

              alt="bored dogs in a camper"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I was bummed because the internet (cell service) was even more
            horrible than usual, and I had forgotten to download my Udemy
            classes, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could have taken the opportunity to paint, but there's just
            something about being so soggy and cold that I just didn't even want
            to. I went through more pairs of socks that weekend than I ever did
            on any week-long camping trips! I hate soggy feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, that was the only day that required ranting about. The
            next couple of days were temperate and comfortable. We were even
            able to get some fishing in.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started out fishing the road to the campground, which has always
            been a good spot. However, nothing was biting, and we discovered
            that our rock-hopping abilities are a little rusty. Many of the
            roads have a wide strip of bowling-ball-ish size rocks put down to
            stop erosion. They are wobbly and dangerous to walk on, and even I
            had issues. But hubby really struggled because of his bad ankle. So
            we decided that we would try fishing again the next day, but try a
            different spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            We haven't been fishing in several years, and we weren't even sure
            if we could find some of our favorite backroad spots anymore. Hubby
            was skeptical, and even disagreed about the turns I said to take a
            few times, but guess who was right and remembered every single spot!
          </p>
          <p>
            The sad part, that we hadn't realized until we started looking for
            the spots, is how much Roscoe was a part of most of them! We have,
            "the spot where Roscoe fell asleep on my tacklebox," "the spot where
            Roscoe ripped all the belt loops off my pants," "the spot where we
            grilled hot dogs for Roscoe while we were fishing" . . . He really
            was a big part of our fishing trips back in the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="mypic"
              src="./images/RoscoeTackleBox.jpg"
              alt="puppy sleeping on a tacklebox"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it was sad at first, we've decided to keep referring to the
            spots that way, in honor of Roscoe's memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The water was down too much at "spot where Roscoe fell asleep on my
            tacklebox" and "spot where we grilled hot dogs for Roscoe," so we
            fished at "spot where Roscoe broke all my belt loops." Even at that
            spot, though, we had to fish in a slightly different location
            (farther down the road) since the lake is way down. Instead of the
            road disappearing into the lake, it is out of the lake and you can
            drive it all the way across the lake now (though it still has "road
            closed" signs you have to drive around). We were there about two
            hours and caught five small-ish Northern Pike. Not terrible, but not
            as good as the fishing usually is.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of the lackluster fishing, it was great to sit there beside
            the lake. We sill definitely be doing it again. Next time, I'm
            bringing my "Writing" notebook, though!
