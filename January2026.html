            I'm glad 2025 is behind us, and I'm looking forward to 2026 being a
            better year (which I think I say every year).
          </p>

          <p>
            Another thing I'll be glad to leave in the rear-view mirror is this
            winter! We are having the sort of winter where I'm already sick of
            it...and technically, it's only been calendar winter for a couple of
            weeks!
          </p>
          <p>
            We've already had two snow days, and the snow in my backyard is deep
            enough that it has "buried" the pond. But the worst part has been
            the freezing rain. We've had constant icy roads. And it's not even
            the "weather is so warm" kind of rain. This is the "warm air aloft
            so it's raining while it is only 17 degrees outside" type of rain!
          </p>
          <p>
            So although we've had a few cold-snap, minus 20 degree days, the big
            issue has been constant snow, rain, and ice. This winter isn't as
            cold (yet). Instead, it's all about the roof rakes, snowblowers, and
            ice melt.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I'm over it! But we still have at least four months of winter
            (five, if it ends up being like the year before last, where we had
            snow and freezing temps while camping over Memorial Day)!

          <h5>The writing update</h5>
          <p>
            I did Novel November, but I did not make the goal of 50K words. I
            did just over 29K words, which I'm pretty happy about. In November
            of 2024, I wrote less than 5k (I went back and checked), so this
            year's Novel November was a vast improvement!
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't write every day, or even almost every day, but I really
            want to get back into that habit. So I'm going to try a mini goal
            going forward for 2026: at least 250 words/15 minutes per day, every
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was only going to do a word count goal, like I usually do, but I
            want my goal to cover editing, revision, submission, and all the
            other work that goes into writing and publishing, and a minutes per
            day goal fits all those better. I'm also counting all “thinking”
            writing in this, but not any writing I do at my day job. School
            counts. If I'm writing this blog, that counts. If I'm writing a
            paper or something for my class, that counts. On the other hand,
            writing a grocery list or composing an email for my day job do not
            count.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know it doesn't seem like much, but it's actually a great place to
            start. It's a minimum, so I can do more in a day if I have time.
            I've already noticed that if I manage to put my butt in the chair
            with the intention of working on writing for 15 minutes, I usually
            end up going much longer. If it's too easy, I can raise the goal at
            some point in the year. And even if I only hit the goal minimum, at
            the end of the year I will have written roughly the equivalent of
            365 pages, which is a lot more than I have been these last few
            years!
          </p>
          <p>
            But most importantly, it's very achievable. No matter how busy the
            day, I should be able to squeak out a few minutes, even if just
            before bed. It's like the Duolingo Spanish goal: a lesson every day.
            They take anywhere from three to seven minutes. And I've been able
            to hit that goal every day for over 600 days. I should be able to do
            that with my writing, as well!
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I'm working on a revision on "Old Gods" before I resubmit it.
            Since I ran into right to the submission wire for the original
            submission call, it could use a little more polishing before it gets
            sent out for regular submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also playing with a few new stories I've started that might have
            merit. And I'm also revisiting two fiction projects I've dabbled
            with from time to time. I've given up on the non-fiction
            project--not all ideas are meant to come to full life. But I think
            it's worth it to have another look at these two fiction projects to
            see if they are viable.

          <h5>What I'm reading</h5>
          <p>
            I abandoned the online university book club book. It just wasn't my
            cup of tea, and I wasn't going to force myself to read it. Life is
            too short to read books you don't find interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I managed to miss ALL the book clubs in November and December,
            I did finish all the books.
            <cite>Buffalo Hunter Hunter</cite>, by Stephen Graham Jones, was
            awesome, and I loved it. Definitely glad I bought it instead of
            borrowing because it's a great addition to my personal library.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also read
            <cite>Christmas and Other Horrors,</cite> edited by Ellen Datlow. As
            with most anthologies, it had stories I really enjoyed, and stories
            that fell flat.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read a non-fiction book related to my "technology and society"
            area of study. I've been attending a monthly AI webinar series, and
            the book was recommended by one of the presenters:
            <cite
              >If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman AI Would Kill
              Us All,</cite
            >
            by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can guess, this book is definitely anti-AI...or,
            anti-too-smart-AI. And while there are definitely areas which might
            be skew toward alarmist hyperbole (it reminds me a bit of The Hot
            Zone, in that regard), the authors do make a lot of great points. It
            also has a lot of supplemental materials that I'm still going
            through, so it's a lot, but overall, I enjoyed the book.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next up, I'm reading the Circle <cite>The Circle</cite> by Dave
            Eggers for the year-long reading challenge. The January challenge is
            to read a book that is part of a series.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the book clubs this month, I read
            <cite>Haunt Sweet Home</cite>, by Sarah Pinsker. This one is for the
            horror book club this month, but it doesn't quite land right for me.
            I didn't know "cozy horror" was a thing. Good book, good writing,
            but not quite my preference. I listened to this one on Audible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my regular book club, I read
            <cite>Into the Drowning Deep</cite>, by Mira Grant. This one was
            definitely more to my taste, and scary as hell! I don't want to give
            away too much, but this one had lots of clever ideas in it, kept me
            on the edge of my seat (or holding my breath while I'm on the
            treadmill, as that's where I do most of my reading these days), and
            I really enjoyed it. I also purchased this one in paperback, and I'm
            glad I did. It's going into my personal library, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also read <cite>The Correspondent: A Novel</cite>, by Virgina
            Evans. I had bought the book a bit ago, during one of my
            pseudo-Scholastic Book Club for Grownups orders (yeah, I'm weird),
            and I hadn't gotten around to reading it. Then I saw it's the
            January book club choice for a book club I haven't been to yet, so I
            thought I read it, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for those of you keeping track, I usually read books from TWO
            book clubs, but I've missed attending those book clubs in November
            AND December, so my response is to read THREE book club books in
            January! Rofl!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm hoping that I at least make the two regular book clubs in
            January. If I make the third, so much the better. And that third
            book was really, really great. Another one that I'm glad I bought
            and read. I highly recommend it!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also reading a couple of anthologies that I've picked up just
            for quicks. I've gotten back into that habit of having four or five
            books that I'm reading all at once. That's a great thing!

          <h5>What I've been watching</h5>
          <p>
            Hubby is definitely a movie guy, but I prefer books. Still, I try to
            occasionally watch movies with him. Usually, if we watch movies
            together, it's while we are camping. But this year, with no camping
            season, it has taken more effort to make sure we have an occasional
            movie night.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my obsession with all things AI and technology, I decided to
            start watching some AI-related movies. So I've actually watched an
            unusual amount of movies these last two months!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <cite>The Roses.</cite> This was a "hubby and I movie night"
              choice, and it was okay. Nothing too great, but not bad, either.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>The Long Walk</cite>. Movie night selection. It was good.
              Not as good as the book (they never are), but still really good.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>Bicentennial Man</cite>, with Robin Williams. This was part
              of the AI selections, and I liked it the first time I watched it
              not long after it came out. But this time, it seemed like it was
              too sped up. They were rushing through the timeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>Bladerunner</cite>. An AI selection. OMG. I was pretty sure
              I had watched this movie before, but none of it seemed familiar.
              Also: hated it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite>. An AI selection. I know I
              watched this one before, and I though I liked it back then. I do
              not like it now.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>Her</cite>, with Joaquin Phoenix. An AI selection. Though
              this movie has been on my radar for years, I put off watching it.
              I was wrong. It's a pretty good movie.
            </li>
            <li>
              <cite>Wonderland</cite>, Korean 2024 (so it's not confused with
              the US movie about a porn star). An AI selection. The best AI
              movie of the bunch so far. While I have more on my list yet to
              watch, if I had to recommend to AI-topic movies to watch, I suggst
              you watch <cite>Her</cite> and <cite>Wonderland</cite>. Both good
              stuff.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I still have quite a few AI-related movies on my list to watch, but
            I've also been feeling nostalgic about the rock operas of the 70s
            and 80s. So I'm going to add a few of those to the "To Watch List,"
            too.

          <h5>Education & Learning update</h5>
          <p>
            Most of my hobby learning is the same, with a focus on Udemy
            Spanish, Java, and Javascript... and I'm back as a paid subscriber
            to Duolingo. It's disappointing how they've changed the free
            version, but it is what it is. The app is good for quick language
            lessons (obviously; I'm almost at 650 days of learning,
            continuously, without a single skip day). It's just that a paid
            subscription is the best way to enjoy it since they've made the
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got an A in my class last semester at the university. Yay, me!
            This semester, I signed up to redo the computer class I took 20
            years ago on Social Implications of Computing Technology. I can't
            wait to see how much the subject matter of the class has changed!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was excited about the textbook for the class, since the class
            still uses the fifth edition of the same, original textbook. I still
            own my first edition textbook from the class!
          </p>
          <p>
            But gettingh the textbook has been an adventure in and of itself. I
            ordered it from Amazon on October 27, and in spite of saying "ships
            from Amazon" (I always check before I order), it did that "Delivery
            expected November 23 to December 31st" thing that some orders do
            (where's it coming from? Amazon warehouse in Siberia?).
          </p>
          <p>
            So the November deadline came and went. So then it just shifted to
            saying "Arriving by December 31st." Once we were in the week of the
            31st, it shifted the wording to "Delivery on Wednesday"...even
            though it hadn't shipped yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when I got up on Wednesday morning, the order had
            auto-cancelled. No "We are sorry your order is late" like you
            usually get in these cases. Just a flat-out cancelled. And Amazon
            even deactivated the invoice. As in, the book still shows in my
            order list, but you can't click on the order number or anything to
            see what the cost was supposed to be, who it was being sold by, etc.
            Which is really, really weird. I've never seen that happen before.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I've ordered it from another seller. It's still supposed to
            ship from Amazon, but this time, the expected arrival date is next
            week. Let's see if this one actually ships!

          <h5>This month's editorial.</h5>

          <p>
            Since it's the New Year, what else belongs here but a list of The
            2026 Goals!
          </p>
          <p>Write for 15 minutes or 250 words a day.</p>
          <p>Start attending my book clubs regularly.</p>
          <p>
            Keep going with my walking: at LEAST 10 miles a week of dedicated
            walking (doesn't include fit-bit stuff like going up and down the
            stair to do laundry or walking across campus). Once the weather
            warms back up, I plan on taking Penny out to Turtle River State Park
            every weekend that we aren't camping, just as I did this last year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add more strength training in 2026. I've really fallen off the wagon
            with strength training, and it's super important the older I get.
          </p>
          <p>Have at least one movie night every month with hubby</p>
          <p>
            And the biggest, most challenging one: get good on my rollerskates.
            I've had them for years--I think I bought them in 2019--and I've
            only put them on a couple of times...a couple of VERY wobbly,
            frightening times, lol. It's time to either get good with them or
            put them up in a garage sale.
