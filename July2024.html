          <p>
            I cannot believe how quickly this year is zipping by. Half over
            already. I was in my Google Notes, preparing a camping menu, and I
            happened to glance at a note I made in February or March. It's a
            list of things I wanted to get done over summer while I take a break
            from my university classes.
          </p>
          <p>Ugh, lol.</p>
          <p>
            I have been working on some of the things (revamp the website;
            organize the art studio), but there are some things that I haven't
            even touched yet.
          </p>
          <p>Like taking care of the underhouse storage.</p>
          <p>
            When we moved into this house, it was a panicked clusterf***. We had
            a short window to get out of our old house for the new buyers. On
            top of that, Hubby broke his ankle mid-move. So friends and family
            jumped in to help out and got us moved in pretty much one day. That
            meant that everything we owned (or everything we deemed important
            enough to bring or remembered to bring--we actually inadvertently
            left a lot of stuff behind) was shoved pell mell into boxes and cars
            and dumped either in the garage of the new house or in the
            underhouse storage space.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Note: clarification on underhouse storage. The house is a
            multilevel, so the entire main floor has a three or four foot space
            beneath it that is accessible from the basement bedroom; it's part
            of the house, indoors, and temperature controlled, but only suitable
            for storage)
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn't take too long to get the garage cleared out and organized,
            but most of the stuff in the "underhouse storage" hasn't been
            touched. As a matter of fact, a lot of it has been buried by either
            stuff removed from the garage or by new stuff that's been put into
            storage. So it's actually even more of a disorganized mess than when
            we moved in!
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's a constant thing on my to-do list. And as I looked at this
            Google Note, I realized that we've now lived here almost SIX YEARS!
            I don't think I can even officially refer to this house as "the new
            house" at this point...it's just "the house." And yet I still have
            "move-in" mess (underhouse storage) that hasn't been done!
          </p>
          <p>
            I think after six years, we are beyond the "we've moved and some of
            our stuff is still in boxes" stage!
          </p>
          <p>
            When a task has been on your to-do list for this long, there's a
            bigger problem than "I just can't seem to find time." And that
            reason is that I just don't want to, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be a pretty big job to accomplish, but it's not
            insurmountable. I just have to actually do it, that's all.
          </p>
          <p>
            And my Google Note reflects this. It says, "One box per week." The
            subtext is: Please, come on. Let's get started on this. One box a
            week, that's all. You can do one box a week, right???
          </p>
          <p>No. Apparently, I cannot. &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;</p>
          <p>
            Oh well. I guess I'll get to it eventually. Maybe August. August is
            our down time for camping, so my weekends will all be free up until
            classes start...&#128521;

            All other things (writing, reading, movies, etc.) have fallen by the
            wayside lately. My independent learning projects have kind of taken
            over lately. I'm still working on several at the same time
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>My 3-Minute Spanish</li>
            <li>My Udemy HTML/CSS class</li>
            <li>A full-stack developer class</li>
            <li>A biology refresher course (for my day job)</li>
            <li>A pagan course</li>
            <li>and, of course, Duolingo</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some days, I just work in one. Some days, I work in all of them. I
            just shift between each one as I get bored. Not only is it a good
            way to spend my time more wisely (instead of scrolling through my
            phone or playing on my apps), it's also a good way to finally start
            using up some of these notebooks I've been hoarding for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seriously, what is with us writers? Almost every writer I know
            either has a hoard of notebooks or they have "special notebooks"
            that they've bought but are saving and never use. I'm firmly in the
            "every year, buy them by the case from Walmart during school supply
            season."
          </p>
          <p>
            And to clarify the difference between "Journal" and "Writing,"
            "Writing" is where I do my typical kind of fiction writing: story
            ideas, scenes, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Journaling" is actually a class I'm also taking at Udemy. It has
            exercises and such, so I keep a journal notebook for that class
            separate from my "usual" writing.

        <section id="pondering">
          <p>This month's rant is climate change.</p>
          <p>
            One of the few advantages to living in the ridiculous cold in North
            Dakota is that the winters aren't friendly to bugs. Our cold weather
            means that mosquito season has an end and we don't have to worry
            about wasps.
          </p>
          <p>Or didn't, anyway.</p>
          <p>
            These days, I'm seeing lots of wasps (and other varmints) That we've
            never seen here before. And I swear that during the heat of late
            July and August, I'm hearing either a katydid or some variation of
            jarfly (cicada). They aren't everywhere all the time the way they
            seem to be in the south, but you can hear a long-drawn out buzz from
            the trees from time to time. Which either tells me that several of
            them have started to make their way here but they can't breed...or
            there are JUST enough of them to start small breeding populations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even worse, after all these years being around animals, and all
            these years of having dogs, I just saw my first flea...and then
            another, and another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, you read that right. I had never seen a flea before in real
            life until the last week in June, when I found one on Honey Booboo's
            face. And then a few days later, I found two more.
          </p>
          <p>AND NOW I AM FREAKING OUT!</p>
          <p>INSERT PICTURE OF PLAGLUE DOCTOR HERE</p>
          <p>
            We used to have dogs that NEVER used any kind of a flea or tick
            treatment, and I never saw a flea. About the time we started taking
            the dogs fishing with us again and camping, we started using
            Frontline just to repel ticks, and that's what we've done every
            summer, ever since.
          </p>
          <p>So I am just at a freaking loss with this flea thing!</p>
