          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            Only a brief update. I'm working on two stories from February's
            flash fiction, plus I've added three more drafts to my inventory of
            "stories to continue."
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing's ready to submit yet, but at least there is some writing
            happening behind the scenes!
          </p>

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>
          <p>
            I haven't watched anything except Survivor and 90-Day Fiance, so I
            have accomplished more reading than usual!
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished <cite>Pests: How Humans Create Animal Villains</cite>, by
            Bethany Brookshire. I heard about this book at a professional
            conference I attend every year, and Bethany was one of the
            presenters this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book was great, and I highly recommend it if you are an animal
            lover, squeamish about "pests" like mice and roaches, or are curious
            about/intrigued by where the lines are drawn between "this animal is
            cute and we should protect it" versus "ick, this is a nuisance that
            must be destroyed." That was one of the discussion items of her
            presentation at the conference: for many people, research using
            beagles, bunnies, etc. is unacceptable; but for many of those same
            people, research using mice and rats is acceptable because they are
            pests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back when we lived in our trailer, I used to put out food for the
            little chipmunk that lived under our shed...until I opened the hood
            of a rental car I was using while my car was under repairs and found
            the engine compartment full of that food.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used to feed the squirrels when we first moved into the new
            house...until one of them decided to make a shortcut to the backyard
            by chewing a hole up through our deck . . . which made the board
            unstable, and caused chubby little Honey Booboo to fall through the
            deck. She was okay, but she could have been badly hurt (or hubby
            could have, if it had happened to him and his weak ankle), so the
            squirrel was no longer a friend.
          </p>
          <p>So I could really relate to the concepts in the book, lol.</p>
          <p>
            Next, I read <cite>I Cheefully Refuse</cite>, by Leif Enger, for a
            book club, and then I forgot all about the meeting date and missed
            it! I wasn't that crazy about the book, so since I wasn't able to
            discuss it with the group, I kinda feel like I read it for nothing,
            lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to mention, this would have been my second meeting at the club,
            so I showed up for one meeting and "didn't come back." They probably
            think I didn't like them, lol (which I did; they seem like a fun
            bunch).
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I'm suffering from choice paralysis. I can re-read
            <cite>Watership down</cite> for a different book club, read the
            selection for the regular book club (though honestly, this next
            selection sounds even less interesting than the last one I read, so
            I'm reluctant), or read a challenge book (the local library has
            themed challenges, and the latest is for books about libraries; I
            ordered <cite>The Giver of Stars</cite>, by Jojo Moyes just in case
            I want to try the challenge). or read the newest book from Stephen
            Graham Jones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, I could read either of the two "favorite authors" books I
            recently ordered: <cite>The Buffalo Hunter Hunter</cite>, by Stephen
            Graham Jones, or <cite>Wandering Stars</cite>, by Tommy Orange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, I could read the one book I ordered from an author who presented
            at the UND Writers Conference,
            <cite>Seek You: A Journey Through American Loneliness</cite>, by
            Kristen Radtke.
          </p>
          <p>So many books, so little time.</p>
          <p>
            Whatever book I choose next, I'm going to keep trying to attend one
            book club or another because it's good motivation for me to actually
            set things aside and take time to read.

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>
          <p>
            I'm not taking classes this summer at the university, so my next
            class will be in the fall. I've registered for a sociology class,
            Technology and Society.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have roughly four classes left to finish the social science major
            (including my fall class). I have four credits left for the computer
            science minor (one or two classes, depending on how the credits
            shake out). So taking classes in fall and spring, I should be done
            by Spring 2028 (Fall 2028, if I can find a single computer science
            class worth four credits). I can push that up to Spring '27' if I
            start taking summer classes again, but it's not like I'm in a hurry
            to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still doing Duolingo for Spanish, and I passed my one year
            anniversary (365 days straight of practice).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also still doing a Spanish class through Skill Success and
            lessons through Dreaming in Spanish. I'm still learning Java through
            Udemy, and full-stack developer through Codecademy (I'm on
            Javascript. Yay!) I'm also doing a refresher HTML/CSS course through
            Free Code Camp.
          </p>
          <p>The newest subject added to my "education" is meditation.</p>
          <p>
            It seems to help with the stress and with anger management. But the
            area it helps most with is sleep!
          </p>
          <p>
            I rarely have trouble falling asleep, but I often wake up several
            times during the night. And when I do, my mind starts churning, and
            the next thing you know, I have insomnia and can't get back to
            sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the first courses I took on meditaiton talked about monkey
            brain, and that is EXACTLY my problem. It can be bad during the day,
            but my monkey brain really goes full tilt when I should be sleeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now when I wake up in the middle of the night, I immediately go
            into my meditation mode (relax, take some reset breaths and do a
            body scan), and then repeat the first "mantra" I learned. I just
            repeat "I am...I am...I am..." over as I mostly focus on my breath.
            Sometimes I separate them by breath ("I" on the in breath, "am" on
            the exhale), and sometimes I just say it independently of the
            breaths. But whichever I do, I don't repeat it more than two dozen
            times before I'm sound asleep again! For that alone, learning about
            meditation was worth it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Why it works, I have no idea. Especially considering it's just the
            incomplete phrase, "I am." Maybe becasue it's close to "Om"? I don't
            know, and I don't really care. I'm just glad it works!
          </p>
          <p>
            And speaking of meditation classes, I took several different ones.
            Some were good, and some were meh. I hope to get some of the
            certificates uploaded this month or next.

          </p>
          <p>
            We've camped in the past while he's recovered, but I'm not doing it
            this year. It's a whole lot more work for me because I have to do
            all the camper set up and tear down, all the dog care (including
            potty breaks), etc. Plus it's a bummer that he can't walk with us,
            and he almost always ended up frustrated that he's stuck at the
            campsite. So why do it if it's going to lead to more work and more
            frustration?
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, there's the risk of bad luck. We've had a tire blow
            out before, on our old camper, so we were stuck on the side of the
            road while vehciles whpped past us at 75+ and it was 105 degrees
            outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've had skylights bust and need to be repaired immediately to keep
            out rain and bugs. We've had tornadoes nearby so we've had to get
            out fast.
          </p>
          <p>And last year, our awning got stuck in the "out" position.</p>
          <p>
            If any of these things happen while hubby is recovering, he won't be
            able to do much about it. Worse yet, he'd probably TRY to do
            something about it and mess up his recovery!
          </p>
          <p>
            So I think it's more prudent, less-stressful, and safer to just take
            this year off. If everything goes well, hubby can get his ankle
            fixed up and finally be pain free (or near to it) so that next
            year's camping season can be the best one yet! He's really been
            limited in how much he can enjoy the season, as he's not been pain
            free and/or fully mobile for most of the trips since the 2018
            season.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this month, leading up to his surgery, is all about getting the
            yard ready for staycation. We are still going to enjoy the great
            outdoors, we just won't be camping...not in the campground, anyway.
            I will be camping in the backyard with Penny in the new tent I
            bought. We will have fire pits in the backyard. We will grill out.
            And we'll take lots of walks here in town and out at Turtle River
            State Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all this means work. We have to make sure the fence is secure
            and do repairs. We haven't used the big back yard much, but we will
            during staycation. I need to make sure all the fencing back there
            can keep in my little demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also means making things dog safe. This means trimming the lower
            branches of the pine trees so that I can SEE the corgis to keep an
            eye on them, and blocking off the area behind hubby's workshop with
            chicken wire so they can't get mess with any of the stuff that's
            stored behind the workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional project on my to-do list is to get rid of the pine
            needles under those three trees in the big backyard, as well.
            Hubby's done a good job of keeping the needles raked up beneath the
            pine in the dog yard, since we use that every day. But the three
            pines in the big back yard were neglected when we moved in, and we
            haven't gotten around to dealing with the needles, either (when you
            spend all your time off camping every year during the warm season,
            there's not a lot of time leftover for yard maintenance). So there's
            about 6-8 inches of pine needles under each tree. I'd like to have
            it taken care of by the time we start our staycations, but I'm
            guessing it's going to be a summer project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I'm going to miss hanging out in the camper at Devils Lake
            this year, I'm excited to see how the staycation goes. We have a
            really beautiful yard, and this will be the first time I will be
            taking the time to actually enjoy it. We have a pond back there, and
            I basically just pass by it on my way to and from Hubby's workshop.
            I don't think I've ever just sat beside it and enjoyed it! This
            summer will be a good time to start!
