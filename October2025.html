            As I begin writing this, it is October 3rd. My Box Elder tree has
            shed most of its leaves, and the Honey Locust fronds are a beautiful
            mix of green and gold. Hubby and I are planning a road trip up to
            Itasca to go leaf-peeping since the leaf reports say the leaves are
            at 75%.
          </p>
          <p>
            And my lawn guy is mowing because the grass is six inches long. And
            it is 89 degrees.
          </p>
          <p>In OCTOBER...IN NORTH DAKOTA!!!</p>
          <p>
            I am not used to the light being so low on the horizon while it's
            this warm out! Most years, we even have our first blizzard the first
            week in October.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going leaf-peeping in shorts is going to be fricken weird. But if it
            means a milder winter, I'm all for that.

          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            I've been plinking around with two new stories, but I haven't worked
            on them much. They are still in the "I'm deciding if this is worth
            writing" phase. I've mostly stayed focused on the nostalgia story. I
            finally figured out a great ending for it and finished the story. I
            completed a full revision pass on it at the end of September, and
            now I'm letting it sit for a few days before I come back for another
            pass. It should be ready to submit by mid- to late- October.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've gathered a couple of rejections on the story I have out, but
            there are still a few publishers left to hear from. In the meantime,
            I'm going to dust off another one to send out, so I'll have two of
            my "pre writer's block" stories out making the rounds by the end of
            this month.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also been regularly attending the local writer's group again,
            and that's been awesome. I can't say enough about how important it
            is to surround yourself with other creative people. It really helps
            inspire!
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of which, I also attend the first "Larks and Katydids" from
            the Horror Writers Association. This is an amazing gathering of
            writers just to socialize over Zoom. There is another session coming
            up at the end of October, and I'm really looking forward to it. I
            love my local writer's group, but it's also very cool to hang out
            with writers in my genre, especially since there aren't exactly a
            ton of them locally and I'm not the convention-going type. So the
            Larks and Katydids Zoom meetings are a great way to meet other
            horror writers (and to put a face and voice to some that I've known
            forever online but never "seen").

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>

          <p>
            I finished <cite>Mirrored Heavens</cite>, by Rebecca Roanhorse for
            book club, and it was good. It took me a while to get into it, but
            then I fell in love with the Carrion King, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was then dismayed to find out that it is book 3 in a 3 book
            series, so the story is done--unless the author decides to write
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished <cite>The Picture of Dorian Gray</cite>, by Oscar Wilde,
            but then I missed the book club meeting on it (shocking, right?) I
            read it before, many years ago, and I remember it being more
            interesting, lol. I was not impressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also re-read <cite>The Call of Cthulhu</cite>, by Lovecraft, for a
            different book club, and I finished
            <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite>, by Shirley Jackson, for the
            new horror book club that starts this month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I'm currently reading <cite>The Final Girl Support Group</cite>,
            by Grady Hendrix, for my regular book club, and I'm about halfway
            through the borrowed book <cite>Mordew</cite>, by Alex Pheby. I'm
            really enjoying both of them!

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>

          <p>
            I am absolutely loving my university class this semester. It is
            turning out to be everything I hoped it would. We've been covering
            topics such as the manosphere, mobile tracking, unwillingly becoming
            viral content, the implications of living longer thanks to tech, and
            physiognomy.
          </p>

          <p>It's absolutely fascinating.</p>
          <p>
            And it is a class that requires reflections and responses. So the
            usual course of business is that after we read a text/article, one
            half of the class ponders and responds to the reading. Then the
            other half of the class responds to those original responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is often just as fascinating as the subject matter. The classes
            are mostly made up of people much younger than myself, so I have
            ancient insights to offer (lol) and they have the modern take on
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, I did not know that tracking is generally accepted by
            the younger generations. In my day, the idea of tracking your
            partner was something only weird, controlling creepers tried to do.
            But now they consider it a normal part of a relationship, especially
            since so many of them spent their childhoods being tracked by their
            parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, I was the generation who had to have a PSA to remind our
            parents that they had kids: "It's 10 PM. Do you know where your kids
            are?"
          </p>
          <p>
            So to me, tracking sounds like some crazy shit I would never put up
            with. But I was also the last generation where we weren't handed a
            social security card at birth, because back then, our parents were
            against having a "government number."
          </p>
          <p>
            This knowledge of differing worldviews becomes important as the
            world moves forward with AI. It makes me aware that I look
            at/respond to AI from a GenX viewpoint, and these kids are looking
            at AI from a completely different worldview.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I am absolutely loving it. Registration for next semester is
            coming up at the beginning of next month, and I want to keep
            exploring this focus area. I haven't decided if I'm going to take
            the computer science class that focuses on this area or the
            psychology course that focuses on this, if it is offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pyschology course would help fulfill credits toward my social
            science major. I already took the computer science course, but that
            was 25+ years ago. Back then, it was also only 2 credits. So now it
            would gain me an extra credit toward the computer science minor
            (presuming they will let me retake it for credit) and it would cover
            the extreme advances in tech. When I originally took the course, we
            didn't even have smart phones, much less smart tvs and all the other
            interconnected tech we do now. So I think it would be very
            interesting to retake it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I'm still working on my other stuff: Spanish through Duolingo
            and Udemy, Codecademy, Javascript, etc. I'm still focusing on doing
            at least one Duolingo lesson and one Codecademy lesson daily, and
            doing the others as I have time.

          <h5>This month's pondering/share/rant.</h5>

          <p>
            I've been trying to live my life under the "Offer Accepted"
            principle, as you can probably tell from the amount of stuff going
            on lately in my blog posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Principle of "Offer Accepted" is a little bit like that bad Jim
            Carrey movie, "Yes Man", but it's just not as extreme. It comes from
            a NY Times article about how we are offered so many opportunities to
            do and try things, and yet we come up with so many excuses not to. A
            lot of times, it even seems like we look for excuses to turn
            experiences down.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when I see a class, or an event, or something that seems like it
            might be fun or interesting, I try it. That's how I ended up going
            to the Leathertooling workshop at Turtle River State Park. That's
            how hubby and I just completed a little haunted house for a
            competition at the public library (which, by the way, he REALLY got
            into and had a great time doing it, lol).
          </p>

            "Offer Accepted" is how I ended up at a concert where a band plays
            Metallica on cellos. I hadn't been to a concert in...geez, two
            decades? But I saw it, tried it, and now I have a new band in my
            playlist because it turns out I love Metallica played on cellos,
            lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes the philosophy of "Offer Accepted" works out, like the
            haunted house or Apocalyptica, and sometimes it doesn't...like the
            ceramics workshop I signed up for at the University. &#128514;
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, I'm pretty good at sticking with the whole "age is just a
            number" philosophy and being the only student eligible for the
            senior citizen discount at the local diner usually doesn't bother
            me.
          </p>
          <p>
            But every now and then, the vibe feels off, particularly with some
            student gatherings. And the vibe felt off to me at the ceramics
            workshop. It may not have been related to me--I might have walked
            into a room where the vibe was off already and it had nothing to do
            with me. Maybe a couple of the students were art students with one
            of those classic "feud between creatives" going on. Or maybe the
            students there were the sort of creative types who have an angsty
            vibe--nothing wrong with that, but maybe that's what I was picking
            up on.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, while I did do "Offer Accepted," I also NOPED right out of there
            almost as soon as I got there. So far, that's the only one I've
            bailed on. I've tried other things and decided that they weren't for
            me, but I at least stuck around and tried those.
          </p>
          <p>I can't wait to see what will be the next cool thing to try!</p>
