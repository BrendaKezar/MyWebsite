            No matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on, we can
            all agree that the world is nuts right now. Personally, I've also
            had the added insanity of hubby having to retire suddenly due to
            medical issues. Needless to say, the stress and chaos all around has
            been tremendous.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been trying even harder to meditate and follow the teachings of
            the Stoics to try and keep calm and sane (or, calm-ISH and sane-ISH,
            lol).
          </p>
          <p>
            So a recent article from The Stoic Gym really spoke to me this
            month:
            <a
              href="https://thestoicgym.substack.com/p/the-endless-summer-within-us"
              target="_blank"
              >The Endless Summer Within Us</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's great advice that I'm trying to incorporate into my daily
            practice, especially the phrase, "I choose peace!"

          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            The Nostalgia story was finished and submitted. "Exit 0: Gas, Food,
            Old Gods" is now out in the world and looking for a home.
          </p>
          <p>
            I need to work on resubmitting the other story I had out, but I just
            haven't gotten around to it yet. It received rejections from a
            couple of the places where it was submitted, but then I had to also
            withdraw it from two of the markets it was sent to because they've
            ended up on the "Writer Beware" lists. So now I'll need to find
            other places for it to go to. I have one other story halfway edited,
            so I want to get back to that, as well, and let it start making the
            rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main writing plan for this month is to once again do a short
            story version of NaNoWriMo. Since NaNoWriMo is dead, I'm trying
            ProWritingAid's Novel November combined with Story A Day's November
            session. The goal of 1667 words per day, every day, probably isn't
            sustainable for me beyond these intensive monthly challenges. But
            I'm hoping it will get me in the habit of carving out some time
            every day for 500 - 1000 words . . . which is way more than I've
            been doing for the last couple of years. This is all about getting
            back into the swing of "being a writer." We will see what works and
            what doesn't.

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>

          <p>Reading has been an adventure lately. Oy.</p>
          <p>
            I finished Mordew, but I really didn't like it. The first part of
            the book was great, but it really fell apart in the second half. It
            almost seemed like there was a gap, maybe, when it was written? Like
            the first half was written, then the book sat for a while, and then
            the author came back and wrote the second half. It was a completely
            different story, it seemed like. And it dragged on forever. Although
            I managed to finish it, I hated every moment of the last billion
            pages (or it felt like a billion, anyway).
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished <cite>The Final Girl Support Group</cite>, by Grady
            Hendrix, and I did enjoy that one. Unfortunately, as I am prone to
            do, I missed the book club meeting discussing it. But the book was
            great!
          </p>
          <p>
            I did make it to the first meeting of the Horror Book Club, and that
            was awesome! It was at a restaurant instead of the library, so that
            was a little weird, but it was nice to have an adult beverage while
            we discussed the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            And more people showed up than there was room for! I'm sure that
            won't be the case for the second meeting because there are always
            people who decide, "yeah, not for me." But I'm excited to see where
            it goes and how many people stick around to be regular members!
          </p>
          <p>
            For that book club, I am currently working on
            <cite>Buffalo Hunter Hunter</cite>, by Stephen Graham Jones. I am
            LOVING it. It took me a little bit to get into it, which is unusual
            because I LOVE SGJ's work. But now I'm vested and enjoying it. I was
            a little lost at the beginning, so I think this is one that deserves
            a re-read. I think I will enjoy it even more the second time around.
          </p>
          <p>
            My borrowed book this time was <cite>Chain Gang All Stars</cite> by
            Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, and I absolutely loved it. It was
            definitely the gold medal winner this time around. The premise is
            very much like the "The Running Man." Criminals are being forced
            into life-and-death battles as a form of entertainment, this book
            takes a more literary/sociological perspective on it, focusing on
            the problems of our real-world justice system and the racial and
            social bias within it. This one wins the "Damn, I wish I'd written
            that" award. As an illustration of how good I thought it was, this
            is one of those books where I originally borrowed it but plan to buy
            it and add a copy to my personal library. High praise, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a real joy to have two books that I'm really enthusiastic about
            and a third that I enjoyed, even if I'm not super ecstatic about it.
            Too often, I can barely get through a book (or don't at all, like
            with A Stranger in a Strange Land) or it's just "meh." So it's great
            to have a run of really good books.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which brings me to the last book I'm working on, lol. I don't know
            if I'm going to make it through it. It's a book chosen for our
            "distance learning" book club. The university is putting forth a big
            effort to build a feeling of community among the distance/online
            students, which is AWESOME. The book, however, stinks. The really
            sad part is that I already had the book in my Kindle library, long
            before the book club. While the synopsis sounds interesting, this
            wasn't a book I would have bought. I had to have gotten a free copy
            through a promotion, first reads, or as a giveaway. So now I'm
            really, REALLY glad I never paid for that book!

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>

          <p>
            I am still really enjoying my class this semester and glad I decided
            to choose it. Registration for next semester is this week, and I've
            decided to retake the computer science course, "Social Implications
            of Computer Technology." It will fulfill a credit toward my computer
            science minor, and I think it's a natural choice after the sociology
            course I'm taking. And it will nice to get an "update" from the
            first time I took the class, 30 years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            The funny thing? The class is using the same textbook. Not the same
            edition, of course, just the same book, fifth edition. I've been
            taking classes off and on for a lot of years, and this is the first
            time I've seen the same title used for this span of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was a book I kept. So I still have the first edition of the
            textbook for this class. It's useless, other than as an interesting
            artifact, lol. Back in that first edition, not only did we not have
            AI, we didn't have social media or smart phones. So a lot has
            changed! I'm looking forward to seeing how the class pans out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm kind of focusing my major/minor on "society and technology,"
            which is a concentration that the university does offer in grad
            school: Master's in Human-Technology Interaction. But they don't
            offer a degree for it in undergraduate studies, and I'm not
            interested in grad school. So I'm trying to pick undergrad classes
            from different disciplines that relate to that focus. I plan on
            taking some AI courses eventually, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other learning fronts, most of my stuff is the same. The only
            thing that may change is that I may drop Duolingo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duolingo has switched from "lives" to energy, and I hate it. Even
            without getting anything wrong, you lose one energy point every time
            you answer a question. If you get x amount of questions right in row
            during a regular lesson (not the stories or listening sessions), you
            get some energy back (5 points, I think).
          </p>
          <p>
            You used to be able to do multiple lessons in a day, as long as you
            didn't get any wrong. Now, with this "energy" and it being depleted
            with even correct answers, it's impossible to do several lessons in
            a day because you are guaranteed to run out of energy. And while you
            do gain some back, you don't gain as much as you lose. So every
            lesson leaves you with a deficit. I think during yesterday's
            session, I got one answer wrong and was able to complete two lessons
            before running out of "energy."
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't like it. And I'm actually thinking about dropping it. The
            lives-to-energy change was just the final straw. They've made a lot
            of changes to it over the last year that are annoying and even
            creepy at times. I've stuck with it this long because it's awfully
            hard to give up that 585+ days-long streak of learning Spanish. But
            this "energy" nonsense might be the thing that pushes me over the
            line.

          <h5>This month's pondering/share/rant.</h5>

          <p>
            This is my birthday month. I won't tell you how old I am, but I was
            definitely feeling my age for a bit these last four to six weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            One evening a few weeks ago, I decided to take my book out to the
            writer's deck and read under the gazebo while listening to the
            beautiful rain pattering down. Getting so close to winter, rain has
            become a precious thing. Unfortunately, I misjudged the surface of
            the writer's deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of all the vines that make up the canopy over the writer's
            deck, the deck is prone to green-algae and moss. That's no big deal,
            because I'm used to it and proceed with caution. This time, however,
            I noticed that the deck was looking really dark colored. I just
            assumed it was dirt that had blown in. We had a few wind advisory
            days, so it wasn't surprising that some of the rich, black farmland
            ended up coating my deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was NOT dirt. It was slime mold. And it was the slickest thing
            I've ever stepped on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got one foot out the patio door and onto the deck, and I slipped
            like a cartoon character on a banana peel. I literally went
            completely horizontal in the air, no part of my body in contact with
            any surface, and crashed down. It felt like being body slammed by
            Hulk Hogan. If I had been Wiley Coyote, I think I could have held up
            a little "HELP!" sign in the time between the slip and the crash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Worse yet, because I had been mid-stride, and my left leg had still
            been "in the house" and not in contact with floor, my knee was bent
            back behind me when I landed, to the point that when I hit the
            ground, my left heel kissed my left ear.
          </p>
          <p>I am not that flexible normally!</p>
          <p>
            At least I didn't feel like a complete clumsy dolt because the dogs
            all ran out to see if I was okay and they Bambi'ed this way and that
            because they also couldn't get any traction on the slimy deck. So at
            least it wasn't my ineptitude...at least, not completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it HURT. It happened on a Friday, but I didn't want to sit
            around in an ER, so I waited to see a doctor until Monday. She did
            an x-ray, but nothing was broken. That, in and of itself is a
            miracle. That was a hard fall, and I fell into a ridiculous
            pretzel-position. I should have shattered like glass!
          </p>
          <p>
            But the doc was worried that I had torn ligaments and what not, so
            she said the typical insurance thing is to wait ten days, and if
            it's still a problem, do an MRI. Well, I have never had an MRI, and
            don't want one. And my leg, while still painful, regained some range
            of motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I rested it for a few weeks. After a bit, I started doing some of
            the rehab exercises I found online. Over time, the pain got less. I
            still don't think it's back to 100%. It still seems to get fatigued
            easily and still hurts when I try to bend it to either side (as in
            sit with my legs curled under me, out to the side, on the couch, or
            bring my left foot up and rest it on my right knee). But I am back
            to walking 2.5 miles a day. I'm just a little stiff afterwards,
            which makes me feel my age.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm looking forward to getting it back to 100% though, so I can go
            back to the illusion of how old I am in my head: 33. Rofl.
