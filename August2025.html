            This seems like it's been a ridiculously hot summer so far. I don't
            remember ever having so many 85+ degree days in April/May/June
            before! As I write this, it's July 3rd, and I should be looking
            forward to taking Penny out to Turtle River State Park tomorrow on
            my day off.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's forecasted to be 77 degrees at sunrise tomorrow. And
            when you walk in the woods, what do they always advise as protection
            against disease-carrying ticks and mosquitoes? Wear long sleeves and
            long pants.
          </p>
          <p>No thank you.</p>

          <p>
            So we'll be walking here in town. We'll still be walking early,
            before the sun is high and hot and has a chance to heat up the
            sidewalks, but on paved in-town trails where I can wear shorts.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's one of the things that's disappointing about living here.
            Winter is six months long, and I'm not an outdoors-in-winter person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once it warms up, you get a month or two of decent (but
            unpredictable) weather. Then for the next three or so months, it
            gets so warm that you have to try and cram all your outdoor
            activities into the early morning hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still need to get the needles taken care of under the last pine,
            but I've been prioritizing walking time. Eventually, though, I'm
            going to have to give up a morning or two and take care of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then, if we are lucky, we get a month of nice fall weather. Then
            all the leaves blow off the trees in one very windy day and winter
            is back again for six months.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I prioritize the walks. If I end up having to rake up pine
            needles when it's 30 degrees, so be it!

          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            I have made it two meetings of my local writer's group and am
            currently working on two stories!
          </p>
          <p>
            The first story I'm working on is a revision/polish on one of the
            last stories I was working on before I stopped writing. I'd like to
            get it polished up and submitted somewhere before the end of the
            summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other story is a new one. I'd call the genre, "Summer nostalgia
            horror." I got the idea of maybe coming up with some summer-themed
            horror stories, and this was the first idea that popped in my head.
            It's kind of cool, so I ran with it. The draft is still in progress,
            but it's about 3200 words so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            And going to writer's group has been awesome. I've been a member
            since the very first meeting, but I haven't attended in years. Going
            back to it, though, was just like I never left. There are new faces,
            but enough familiar faces to make it really seem like I'm just
            picking back up after a long weekend or something. I absolutely love
            it!
          </p>

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>

          <p>
            I finished
            <cite>Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Fairies,</cite> by Heather
            Fawcett, and I really liked it. I might even read the second book in
            the series. It wasn't anything like what I normally read, so I was
            pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I've doubled up and am reading books for two separate book
            clubs: <cite>Stranger in a Strange Land,</cite> by Heinlein, and
            <cite>Tress of the Emerald Sea,</cite> by Brandon Sanderson. I
            really don't know what to make of either of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heinlein is closer to what I normally read, and I've read several of
            his works in the past. And while I love the premise, this book is SO
            DATED! I keep getting "kicked out" of the story due to all the dated
            references, wrong assumptions of what the future would be like (oh
            look, everybody smokes tobacco these days), and the sexism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tress started out giving the feel of a young adult novel or one of
            the classics like James and the Giant Peach because of the young-ish
            character and the voice of the narrator. But then it move firmly
            into science fiction with the several moons and ships that navigate
            on a sea of spores.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then absurdities in the characters and situations once again
            placed it in "Peach" territory...and then someone's death due to
            spores was described in horrifying enough detail that I don't think
            it would be appropriate for YA or younger.
          </p>
          <p>
            So while I'm enjoying Tress in general, it seems like a bit of a hot
            mess of a book, as far as genre goes. Out of the two books, though,
            I'm enjoying Tress more.

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>

          <p>
            Most of the "lessons" I'm working on are still the same, but the
            frequency that I'm doing the lessons has changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been prioritizing Duolingo Spanish, Udemy Spanish ("Spanish for
            Beginners. The complete Method"), and Codecademy Full Stack. Those
            three I absolutely do every single day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still taking four other Udemy courses--Java, Javascript,
            Mindfulness, and Intro to Biology--but those are less regular. If I
            have extra time in the day, I knock a lesson out in one of these.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I am very much looking forward to getting back to a university
            class in the fall. My last university class wasn't that long ago,
            just last fall (spring was my failed and quickly abandoned
            internship), but it feels like FOREVER!!! I can't wait for classes
            to start!

          <h5>This month's pondering/share/rant.</h5>
          <p>
            So much has happened since the last post, it feels like I've lived a
            year in a month. It's better to summarize it all in tidbits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hubby's recovery from ankle surgery (removal of the failing
            replacement joint and fusion of the joint with a spike up his shin)
            has proved challenging. As of this writing, we still don't know how
            the bones are healing because everyone is focused on the surgical
            wound, which isn't healing. It's required a skin graft and wound
            vac, and we aren't sure if that's going to help. By this point,
            hubby was supposed to be able to start putting weight on his foot,
            but that's not nearly in the cards yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the other testing with related to trying to figure out
            why his wound wasn't healing (and a rehash of "let's test bone stuff
            since he's had a problem with bone healing in the past"), they've
            found some troubling hormonal and blood results that are leading to
            cancer and endocrinology testing. So, on top of the fact that he's
            been dealing with pain/no healing of the broken ankle for SEVEN LONG
            YEARS, now we've got the big "C" word hanging over everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was practically cracking under the stress, my fridge decided
            to be a putz and go out again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fridge had been a constant problem almost since we moved in. It
            was a fancy double-door fridge with a bottom freezer. And,
            periodically, the freezer would freeze over and the whole thing
            (fridge and freezer) would stop cooling. The first time it happened,
            I didn't realize it for a while. So I had to throw out hundreds of
            dollars of food. And while it only happened once every six months or
            so at first (and was blamed on dog hair by techs we talked to by
            phone), it started happening more and more often, in spite of
            monthly vacuuming to make sure no dog hair was caught in the works.
            And when it happened when I was already overwhelmed and exhausted
            from hubby's surgery/health stuff and had NO patience for any
            nonsense, I bought a new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another source of stress was all the traveling. Hubby's doctors are
            in a town 70 miles south of here, and we've been traveling two or
            three times a week for his medical stuff. When the door lock system
            malfunctioned in my car, making it so that the passenger door could
            only be opened from the inside, it was a wake-call. Stella was ten
            years old and just about completely out of her warranty period--even
            for the door lock thing, an known problem that Kia was covering for
            her model...for 10 years. So if the problem had waited a few more
            months and occurred in year 11? I probably would have to pay for it
            out of pocket. And a working passenger door is pretty important when
            you are the sole driver and the passenger is someone with health
            problems.--The new car was because, first and foremost, I deserve a
            treat for how this year has been going. But also because my prior
            car (Stella) was nearing ten years old. So a reliable car is quite
            helpful. While I never had any real problems with Stella, I knew it
            would just be a matter of time before she would need some major
            maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was a practical choice to buy a new car to ensure reliable
            transportation. But I also deserve a treat to brighten my days...so
            I bought a bright blue 2026 Sportage loaded with bells and whistles.
            Her name is Matilda, or Tilda, for short.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started wondering what on earth was up with Hamilton, my hamster.
            He's always been a snack fiend, but he was starting to act like a
            corgi. Every time I would stick a snack into the cage, he would
            snatch it from my hands like he was starving.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I gave him one of his favorite treats, a piece of cheese, I
            realized he wasn't taking bites of it...he was licking it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out, he's lost teeth. How many, I don't know, but enough that
            he's having trouble eating. It's impossible to tell by the quantity
            of food left in his dish because he has always tossed most of it
            out, anyway, because he's a fussy eater.
          </p>
          <p>
            It makes sense, because he's elderly for a hamster. I'm just glad I
            realized it before it was too late.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now he gets his regular food (a mix of seeds, nuts, etc.), plus
            he gets an "old man" mix: baby food veggies, soggy dog kibbles, and
            soggy oat mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, Penny and I made our first hiking video in June. I decided I
            love the virtual hikes enough that I want to give a go at making my
            own. And while our first video didn't turn out as bad as I thought
            it would, it does need a reshoot because the camera view isn't quite
            how I like it for a virtual hike. All in all, that's a small problem
            and I'm really surprised by how well everything turned out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought making my own hiking videos for the treadmill might be a
            hobby I'd like to take up, but I figured it would require special
            expensive equipment. So I just bought a cheap chest harness for my
            phone to try it, and if I liked it, I would do an upgrade on
            equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read stuff where people were talking about upgrading their
            action-cameras-of-a-certain-brandname because the entry-level ones
            had batteries that ran out after 20 minutes, or that shook too much
            while they were walking, etc. I know some people talked about having
            this "geo floating cage" apparatus they wore for stability. It all
            sounded completely overwhelming, so I didn't hold out a lot of hope
            for my first attempts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bought a $20 chest rig from Amazon and put my Samsung Galaxy in
            it. And off we went.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recorded an hour walk, and my phone still had well over 50%
            battery left. And there was no more bouncing of the camera than in
            the semi-pro hiking videos I watch. The Galaxy apparently has really
            great image stabilization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only problem with the amateur hiking video Penny and I shot was
            the viewframe. Because the camera is attached to my chest, and it's
            in a brace that covers part of the screen to secure it, it's hard
            for me to judge if the camera is pointed at the optimum angle. The
            videos should mostly focus on the actual path, with the scenery
            filling the rest of the screen. My first video is mostly scenery and
            very little of the path itself showing (camera too high).
          </p>
          <p>
            But I think that's a problem I can overcome with trial and error. So
            for a $20 investment, it's a pretty good result. If we get a few
            good videos, I'll share them on my youTube channel. We'll call them,
            "Walks with Penny," lol.
