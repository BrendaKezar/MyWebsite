            We've had some pretty good temperatures lately (in other words: not
            below zero) and a lot of the snow has melted. The days have gotten
            noticeably longer. The camping reservation window has opened, and
            the UND Writers Conference is this month.

          <h5>Writing update</h5>
          <p>February was an amazing month for writing!</p>
          <p>
            I got some work done on my nonfiction project, but not as much as I
            would have liked. I actually accomplished more on some of the merch
            side of that project, rather than the writing project itself. Maybe
            more on that later. I don't know how much crossover I want with my
            brands, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest writing success was that I decided to try the Writer's
            Digest February Flash Fiction Challenge--and I wrote every single
            day in February!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            I stayed flexible with it. Sometimes I wrote to the prompt, but if
            the prompt didn't speak to me, I sought out a different prompt. I
            ended up with 28 files, ranging from pieces that are just a
            base-synopsis for a story to full-blown stories that that are 75%
            drafted. It doesn't sound like a lot, but for how blocked my writing
            has been for the last few years, this is incredible!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I'm going to spend March picking a few of my favorites and
            finishing them. By April, I want to have at least one ready to
            submit for publication. That's going to be HUGE!
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't say my writer's block is fixed; not yet anyway. But this is
            a very, very encouraging development.
          </p>
          <p>Look out world. I'm back! (maybe, lol)</p>

          <h5>Reading Update</h5>
          <p>
            I finished reading <span class="underline">The Mighty Red</span>. I
            wasn't just reading it because I'm an Erdrich fan. I was reading it
            because I wanted to join a local book club, and one of the
            (surprisingly many) bookclubs in my area had selected it for their
            February read.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actually didn't like this book as much as some of Erdrich's prior
            books. The characters weren't as interesting, it was hard to find a
            likeable character at all to root for, and the plot took odd turns.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, there is a horrible accident in the book. Some people
            survive, some people die. And one character suffers a very, VERY
            serious injury...and we never hear about them again until the very
            end of the book, where there are several "epilogue" type chapters
            that seem like they were tacked on to tie up loose ends. And to make
            a "finally happy ending" years later for a couple of the characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            It feels like she wrote a lot of the book in scenes and chapters,
            then waited a decade or so and went back and tried to patch it
            together and make it work.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was good, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped. A lot of
            Erdrich's earlier stuff (<span class="underline">Love Medicine</span
            >, <span class="underline">The Bingo Palace</span>,
            <span class="underline">Tracks</span>, etc. ) were incredible. So I
            just feel lukewarm about this one in comparison.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed my first book club meeting enough that I went ahead and
            bought the next book they will be reading. It definitely doesn't
            sound like something I would normally read, so we will see how it
            goes. The book club meets at the end of March, so I need to get
            cracking on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But first, I have to finish the book I started after
            <span class="underline">The Mighty Red</span>.
            <span class="underline"
              >Pests: How Humans Create Animal Villians</span
            >. It's nonfiction, and I picked it up because the author presented
            at the last PRIM&R conference (a conference related to my day job).
            I really enjoyed her presentation, her humor, and her absolute
            adoration of mice and rats.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Pests has not disappointed so far. It's a great book, and I
            highly recommend it.
          </p>

          <h5>Classes Update</h5>
          <p>
            I dropped the internship I was taking at the university this
            semester. I should have known it wasn't going to work, but I really
            felt like I had to try. But it's hard to add another 150 hours into
            your work schedule. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is.
            We had hit the midway of the semester, and I had less than half the
            hours I should have accomplished by that point. So I would have to
            do the internship TWO OR THREE TIMES in order to get enough credits
            to satisfy the experience requirement for the major. Bleh!
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a bummer on so many levels, not the least of which is that it
            meant I had to drop out of school. Like many people using the "one
            class per semester" employee benefit, I only take a single class.
            And dropping that class means dropping to zero credits, and that
            means you withdraw from school.
          </p>
          <p>
            I filled out my "drop/withdraw" paperwork on a Monday. It was
            approved the next day. I waited a day, and then re-enrolled so I
            could still have my early registration appointment this month. By
            Friday, I was approved as an enrolled student again.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems kinds of silly. If I can re-enroll in the same week and not
            have an active class, why can't I just "press pause" after dropping
            my class in the first place?
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a little surprised by how much my few days of "non-student"
            status bothered me. I've been classified as a student for the last
            seven years, not even counting the two previous times I was a
            student before I was an employee. So it felt really weird to lost
            that connection. I guess being a student is a bigger part of my
            self-identity than I realized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dropping the internship also means I have to face the facts and drop
            the communication major. I've been fiddling around with trying to
            figure out a way to fulfill the "experience" requirement for the
            major for far too long...even back when I worked at the animal
            facility!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a communication major with an information systems minor. Now I
            am a social science major with a ... yep! You guessed it: computer
            science minor, rofl!
          </p>
          <p>
            I talked to my advisor, and she said completing the minor will not
            preclude me from becoming a computer science major later. This way,
            I can test the waters and see how it goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Worst case scenario: I have a hard time with it and have to be
            satisfied with the minor in computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Best case scenario: it goes great and I pursue a computer science
            degree.
          </p>
          <p>Er, or maybe it's vice versa. &#128521;</p>
          <p>
            My other classes are going well. I'm still studying Spanish, Java
            programming, and doing the full-stack engineer course at Codecademy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also taking some classes on meditation (because the world right
            now is SO YIKES!). So far, it doesn't seem to help much, but I'm
            still early in that learning journey.

            No update here. I haven't had time to work on porting over the old
            website. With the all the other things going on, I'm guessing I
            won't get any new website development (or bringing the legacy pages
            forward to this host) until at least April or May.

          <h5>Review: Recent Purchase Fail</h5>
          <p>
            I decided to try one of those electronic ultrasonic dog training
            devices. It worked….sort of.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have corgis, so we have a barking problem. Now that Booboo is
            gone, Bruce is the worst about it. And I need him to stop so he
            doesn't teach his sister bad habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murphy doesn't bark often, but he does bark when he sees traffic or
            hears something weird (like when they plow the roads). So, when I'm
            working at home, he usually elects to sit on the stairs rather than
            hang out in my office with the rest of us. Unfortunately, we live in
            a multi-level (modified split), which means his spot on the stairs
            means he can see everything that happens outside. He generally only
            barks once or twice, which isn't a big deal. But his barking will
            set Bruce off. And Bruce is just like Booboo: his barker gets stuck.
            He will bark for an hour, if not corrected.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I decided to try one of those training devices that makes a sound
            only dogs can hear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very first time I used it, I saw results. Bruce immediately
            stopped barking.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Murphy barked worse, nose in the air, seeming to yell,
            "What the hell is that noise???"
          </p>
          <p>
            Worse still, Penny immediately ran under my legs and cowered. And
            for the next five or six times that the boys barked, even though I
            didn't use the device, Penny immediately ran to me as if in
            anticipation of the device being activated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Great. It did it's job. It stopped Bruce from barking. But it seemed
            to traumatize the other two dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when I realized I really, REALLY don't like the idea of this
            tool. What the hell does it sound like to them? A train derailing?
            The screams of a dying animal? Nails on a chalkboard? I have no
            idea, because I can't hear it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And what about Hamilton? Can he hear it? I know mice can hear and
            vocalize in different frequencies, so I have to assume hamsters can,
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            What the heck kind of torture device did I just activate in my
            home?!
          </p>
          <p>Nope, nope. . . all the nopes. I tossed it out.</p>
          <p>
            And I know, it's kind of silly. We can't know what the things that I
            can hear sound like to the dogs and Hamilton, so something that's an
            acceptable noise to me might still not be acceptable to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce goes bananas when he hears hubby's ringtone (Sandstorm), and
            does a high, howling whine that I've ONLY ever heard him do for that
            song. So it's pretty clear that the song isn't as enjoyable for him
            as it is for us!
          </p>
          <p>
            But I could clearly see that the device was having a bad effect on
            Murphy and Penny. So it had to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            So my recommendation is to proceed with caution if you have a
            multi-dog household, which is what many of the product reviews also
            mentioned. Some people complained it had no effect whatsoever on
            their dog. Others said it worked. Some had experiences like mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to stick to barking control measures that I can at least
            have a sense of what is happening with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we are back to square one. I'll have to start using the collar on
            Bruce again. It's a manually-activated one, so I don't have to worry
            about him receiving a correction if someone else barks. And since
            he's so tweaky, it doesn't take long for him to react to the tone
            since he HATES the vibration.
          </p>
          <p>Life with corgis, I suppose.</p>
