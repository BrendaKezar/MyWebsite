          <p>
            I am so glad January is over. It hasn't even been that bad
            weather-wise, but I am over it. We only had one negative temp cold
            snap, and it hasn't been very snowy. It's been unusually warm (by
            North Dakota standards), foggy, and drizzly. Usually, I LIKE foggy
            and drizzly . . . but I don't like ice. And that's what we've been
            dealing with constantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only have we been breaking records for warm temperatures and
            even having our first ever December flood warning, there are other
            indications that things are really, really out-of-whack. Normally,
            winter is quiet. One of the things that always startles me the first
            few days of warm weather is how noisy it is when all the birds come
            back. But this year, I think a lot of them have hung around. I had
            cars behind me so I couldn't get a picture, but as I drove through
            the parking lot near the Gorecki Center on campus, I looked up, and
            two of the trees were full of robins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> ROBINS!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Robins . . . in North Dakota . . . in January! It's unnerving. And
            what are they even eating??? Robins are carnivores. I know they will
            eat berries and stuff if they arrive back in spring too early for
            the bugs to be out, but it can't sustain them long term. So what are
            these winter robins doing?
          </p>
          <p>
            Come to think of it . . . when we had our one cold snap so far this
            winter, hubby found two dead birds near our back pine, about a week
            apart.In spite of the fact that I always say, "How the heck do birds
            survive a North Dakota winter," we actually don't find too many dead
            birds around the house in winter, usually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hubby shrugged it off, saying maybe they were already sickly, but
            now I wonder: maybe they were also birds that don't belong here
            right now. Maybe, like the robins, they were lured into hanging
            around due to the warmer temps, and that one sudden cold snap got
            them.

          <p>
            The other reason I'm glad January is in the rear-view mirror is
            because we lost Roscoe this month. My grumpy old man finally left
            his earthly bonds. We knew it was coming, but that didn't make it
            any less heartbreaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            His body has always been a source of misery for him, and it was only
            getting worse. His allergies went from needing seasonal medication
            to needing year-round medication, and even then, he was still
            frequently miserably itchy. He scratched his eyebrow off TWICE last
            summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has also been on antacids his whole life, because in spite of his
            desire to eat ALL THE THINGS, he suffered from a sensitive tummy. We
            cycled through dozens and dozens of different dog foods, with no
            relief for him. Periodically, his digestive tract would start making
            noises like a drain trying to back up, and he would stop eating and
            shiver with pain. We called it having "squirtle belly." This really
            sucked because eating was his second favorite hobby next to camping.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, as he got older, he started getting these weird tumors all
            over. They were diagnosed as benign, but they grew back if removed.
            And he seemed to be suffering from osteoarthritis as he got older,
            as well. That's why we had him on the monthly monoclonal antibody
            shots, to help relieve that. My poor old guy had been taking a
            handful of pills every day for the better part of his life, and for
            the last five or sixth months, he was having to visit the vet
            monthly. He wasn't very happy about it, either.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really glad that this last camping season, he and I spent so
            much time going off-trail. It's was his favorite thing in the world.
            So I can take some comfort in knowing that his last camping season
            was a good one.

            As you've noticed, I'm back to working on my html on off-site pages.
            Part of that is because of my class this semester (more on that
            later), but part of it is because the free site I had been using for
            a little while ticked me off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of the blue, I received an email saying the free host had
            disabled my site and put it up for deletion since it wasn't being
            used. Sure, I hadn't put up any new pages for a bit and had just
            been doing my updates on Wordpress, but I hadn't realized that if
            you don't log in and update your site every now and then with the
            free host, they will disable and delete!
          </p>
          <p>
            Granted, it's my own fault for not paying attention to all the terms
            and rules when I signed up. And, it is a FREE site, so I can't
            complain too much. But between the "dang, I don't know if I can
            update the site every month via html" and the other limitations with
            the free host (no videos), I decided maybe I would try a paid host
            again. Paid hosts don't give a fig if I update or not as long as I
            send them money every month, lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turned out, I was able to get a good deal with my prior paid
            host. So I went back and re-subscribed with them for a year's
            service. It's actually good because it encourages me to actually use
            the hosting and practice my html. After all, I don't like paying for
            something I'm not using, so I feel OBLIGATED to use it!

          <p>Speaking of classes . . .</p>
          <p>
            This semester at the University of North Dakota, I’m taking a class
            for the info systems minor: web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class gives two different options for writing your code:
            Bluegriffon and Visual Studio Code. I had never heard of Bluegriffon
            before this class, but it looks like it is a lot like SeaMonkey,
            which I dabbled with in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            BlueGriffon (and SeaMonkey) are WYSIWYG editors, much like the
            "website builder" apps offered by many webhosts. Frankly, I've never
            cared for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if I'm being perfectly honest, WYSIWYGs feel a little like
            cheating, when it comes to learning HTML. Heck, when I started doing
            HTML again, even IDEs like VSC felt like cheating, lol! Back in my
            day, we wrote our code in Notepad and liked it (uphill, both ways,
            in the snow, ha-ha).
          </p>
          <p>
            But when I starteed programming again, there was a lot of stuff that
            made me make Clint Eastwood grumpy-old-man face.

          <p>
            Back in "my day," we programmed using a text editor like Notepad,
            and we compiled our programs on $1K compiler (a huge expense and
            source of stress for a student trying to learn the profession.)
          </p>
          <p>
            And now you have IDEs that are FREE that auto-populate your code for
            you. A missing closing tag was one of the most common--and hard to
            find--errors back in my day.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so many of the languages today are interpretive. Even for those
            that aren't, there are other options. For the $1K compiler of my
            "old days," that I was so excited about back then when I was able to
            grab one on sale for $300, I now have today's on my computer for
            free.
          </p>
          <p>
            So my dive back into programming has very much felt like the whole
            "kids have it so easy these days" thing, lol. And being allowed to
            work on WYSIWYG feels like that. But I'm sure that people felt the
            same way about calculators in school, too.
          </p>

          <p>
            But you know what? Really, all of this SHOULD be easier than it was
            "back in my day." Isn't that the whole purpose of progress and
            innovation? So that we no longer have to walk five miles to the
            river to get water, but the water should come to us?
          </p>
          <p>
            And maybe that's it. Maybe "cold-coding" is a dying art. We went
            from my original programming days (boot disk), to coding with
            compiling, to IDEs, to WYSIWYGs. I often say that memorizing dates
            and facts, a staple of education "back in my day," is a dumb
            standard that should be dead. Why should I memorize things that I
            can just Google? Why cold-program something like html when I can
            just whip it up with a WYSIWYG? Then I can spend my time worrying
            about learning Python, Java, etc., instead. And, although there
            aren't WYSIWYGs for those languages, I can use IDEs to program them
            much faster than "back in my day."
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not going top rail against these easier methods. I am going to
            embrace the improvements that help me be more efficient while still
            requiring me to develop some skills. I feel like, for me personally,
            IDEs are a useful tool, while WYSIWYG's don't allow me to develop my
            programming muscles. So I will continue to develop my pages through
            an IDE (as this page was created), but I will continue to avoid
            WYSIWYGs like Blue Griffon, Sea Monkey, etc., when I can. I'm going
            to rock it old school with skittles and hot pockets, while using an
            IDE that's going to make sure I close my tags and have semicolons
            where they are expected (which, now that I look at it, means IDEs
            are sort of like Grammar checkers like Grammarly; they don't write
            your code for you, they just check it for accuracy.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (Except, of course, when I'm lazy and pressed for time with this
            author page; then I will happily skip the programming and use the
            (basically) WYSIWYG editor that is Wordpress, lol.)

            UND Writers Conference (happening in March).

            If I start reading an hour a day, every day, I should have my "to be
            read pile" finished by the time I'm 275 years old.

            On the writing front, the Stafford Challenge has been an epic fail
            for me so far, lol. Between grieving for Roscoe, my class, my work,
            my painting, the reading, and the short stories (which I am still
            working on), there has been no time for a poem a day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, that doesn't mean I'm totally out of it. It is a new
            month. We will see if I can get at least a few poems done this
            month. I think I wrote somewhere between three and five at the start
            of the challenge, and I did really enjoy it, so I do want to keep
            trying. I just have to remember to not beat myself if I keep missing
            the mark. I've got a lot on my plate; I always do. And, all this
            stuff (classes, painting, short stories, poetry challenge) is
            supposed to be fun, after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, work continues on the short stories. Two are going well,
            if slowly, but the first one (the original one I was so enthused
            about) has really stalled. The problem is, I don't have an ending
            for it. I posted before how I wasn't sure where the story was going
            to end. So the story and the characters just keep going on and on
            with no ending, no resolution to their story, in sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story is ridiculously long and will have to have major cutting
            during the revison process, but I don't want to start cutting stuff
            out until I know what the ending is going to be. So I'm kind of at
            an impasse with this story until I come up with an endpoint.

            Circling back to the writer's conference, one of the late additions
            to the author line up is Sterling HolyWhiteMountain. Something in
            his conference bio caught my attention:
            <cite>"He is an unrecognized citizen of the Blackfeet Nation."</cite
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, of course, I had to Google him and find out what THAT was all
            about. Here are some links to interviews/essays/etc.

            <cite
              >However, critics quickly took to social media to call out the
              brands for appropriating Native American culture, specifically
              criticizing the turquoise jewelry designs that have, for hundreds
              of years, been a significant part of Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Pueblo
              and other tribes’ cultural and spiritual practices.</cite
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <cite
              >“This is not just knockoff turquoise, but it’s a knockoff of a
              culture. Turquoise has been prized in the Americas for centuries,
              and particularly turquoise works that are wearable,”...“We wear
              the turquoise because it was given to us long ago, and with it
              there are songs. There are prayers."</cite
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I had never before thought about the possibility that turquoise
            should be off limits due to its sacred nature to some cultures.
            After all, I grew up in the seventies, when turquoise jewelry was
            all the rage. I'm pretty sure I still have some of my old 70s
            turquoise jewelry in a box somewhere (not to mention the black hills
            gold and turquoise ring I just bought a year a two ago!)
          </p>
          <p>
            And up until a few years ago, I thought blood quantum was actually a
            good (if questionable) idea. On the surface, it seemed the point was
            to make sure that things that belonged/benefitted indigeneous people
            were reserved for indigeneous people. For example, I thought it made
            it easier(?) to enforce the Native Arts and Crafts Act, which
            attempts to protect Native artisans by prohibiting
            non-indigenous-created goods from being marketed and sold with any
            label/wording that may misrepresent the items as being
            indigeneous-made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I know it's a complex, complicated issue that is often abused
            and even used by some in power to "un-Indian" tribal political
            rivals, etc. And the idea was originally created by the colonizers
            as yet another way to eventually get rid of indigeneous people
            altogether. In other words, it's always been a weapon!
          </p>
          <p>
            These are all incredibly complex issues. Along with varying support
            for blood quantum, the very definition of cultural appropriation
            varies among ethnic groups/nationalities/cultures/tribes, and even
            among individuals within those groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good example is the school mascot situation. When my university
            was debating whether to discontinue their mascot, they polled the
            tribes of North Dakota to get their opinion (and disclaimer: I'm not
            sure if they polled ALL the tribes, or just what they consider the
            "major tribes"). Four out of five of the polled tribes in North
            Dakota voted that it was offensive and should be removed. One of the
            polled tribes voted that it was honoring their people and should be
            kept.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I'm going to continue listening to and learning from those
            willing to teach and share their views. And I will continue to try
            to navigate these complex issues as respectfully as possible.
