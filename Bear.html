    <h1>Taylor Swift and The Bear</h1>
    <p>
      Note: if you came here from someplace else, you are likely missing
      context. I'm a writer who usually has a rant/rave/pondering section each
      month as part of my blog. These tend to me more like "rambling thoughts"
      or "riding the thought-train" sorts of things. I'm experimenting with
      doing some of the more "essay-like" ramblings off-site rather than
      embedded in my blog posts. For May, I was pondering the whole "bear meme"
      phenom and wrote this as a result.
    </p>
    <article>
      <p>
        I'm sure you've seen the “I choose the bear” memes that have been going
        around. If there has ever been anything that has SO proven the “men are
        from Mars, women are from Venus” viewpoint, this meme is it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The premise is that women were asked a question to the effect of: If you
        were walking in the woods, which would you rather run into, a bear or a
        strange man?
      </p>
      <p>
        And many women answered that they would choose the bear. This was
        apparently a stunning answer to many men, and the heated debate began!
      </p>
      <p>
        No, this isn't something that's a result of “the feminist man-hating
        agenda.” Sadly, it shows how many women have been victimized by a man at
        some point in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of men posting butt-hurt memes in response proves the point
        (“Women just love to hate men, and we can't get no love or respect. It's
        so hard to be a man these days.”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of men reacting with, “But that's stupid! Bears are
        dangerous!” proves the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of men saying, “Women seem to think all bears are teddy
        bears” PARTICULARLY illustrates the problem. Do you seriously think this
        meme is about women been so stupid that they think real bears are
        cuddly? I don't know how many of us have managed to survive after we
        watched Grizzly Adams growing up and now we just want to pet every fuzzy
        animal we see in the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, real bears are dangerous. But here are some basic truths about the
        bear in the woods.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I probably wouldn't see the bear to start with because the bear is
          generally going to try and avoid me and get away from me. In general,
          the bear is going to be more scared of me than I am of it. Not so
          much, with men.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am not the natural prey of a bear. And if you think that's
          hyperbole, think about the last time you heard a guy (or yourself)
          talking about heading out to the bar for a night when single (on the
          prowl, on the hunt, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          A bear, unless it is protecting its young, cornered, injured, etc., is
          generally going to turn tail if I act “big” or “aggressive.” Do you
          know what happens when a woman is approached by a man and she acts
          aggressive and dominant? She's a bitch or a c**t. Think about your
          male friends. I bet you know at least one who was rejected by a woman
          and as a result, he refers to her as “that stuck-up bitch” or “that
          c**t” just for turning him away.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Yes, bears are dangerous. And yet, their behavior, if I give them a wide
        berth and be wary, is often less unpredictable than the behavior of the
        human male.
      </p>
      <p>
        And no, not all men. OF COURSE NOT ALL MEN! But I don't know if the
        particular male I've met up with in the woods is a “not all men” or a
        dangerous man, do I?
      </p>
      <p>
        At around the same time the bear meme took off, Taylor Swift released a
        new album. It was met with a lot of hate. I'm a huge fan of Taylor
        Swift, but even I'm kind of “meh” about this album.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one song . . . Oh. It's perfectly timely. “My boy breaks all his
        favorite toys.” Go listen to it. Go read the lyric sheet. It's a perfect
        complement to the bear meme.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the takeaway from the bear meme should be: Women don't hate men.
        They've just learned that there are men who are no different than a
        dangerous dog: until it proves to you that it isn't going to bite, you
        exercise extreme caution around it. The best way to be safe is to not
        give it the chance to bite you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll say it againg for those in the back: No not all men. But how many
        dogs have to bite you before you start being a little wary around them?
      </p>
      <p>
        And how bad is the problem? Surely the meme is (and I am) overstating
        it, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, here's a question for you: do you know someone--a female friend,
        mother, sister, niece, daughter, cousin, etc.--that ever had to be
        walked to her car after work due to safety concerns? If your first
        reaction is to say no, no one I know has ever had that happen to them, I
        challenge you to ask some of the women in your life. I bet you do, and
        maybe they just haven't ever shared the story with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those men who know a woman who has experienced this (needing to be
        walked to their car after work), here is a follow-up question:
      </p>
      <p>
        Have YOU ever had to be walked to your car for your safety? How many of
        your MALE friends have ever had to be walked to their car for safety?
      </p>
      <p>
        Time for a little reflection: If you dismissed any of the article above
        with the words feminist or man-hating, or you agreed with the prior
        paragraph that women just jump at shadows and a man doesn't need to be
        walked to the car because he would neutralize any threat . . . then you
        just might be a part of the reason women choose the bear.
      </p>
      <p>Just sayin'....</p>

        A bit about the author, just in case you came here from another link:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a horror writer, married to one of the good ones. I spend a lot of
        time in the woods, camping, hunting, hiking, fishing, etc., and I always
        carry a weapon just in case of bears . . . or other predators.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate enough to never have required a walk to my car for
        safety, but I've had situations that were close. I was referred to as
        "that stuck-up bitch/c*** " several times in my youth after rejecting
        some men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feminist? Yes, to a degree. Man-hater? Hardly. Not only am I happily
        married to one, but 99% of my friends are male. And, a lot of them will
        admit that they've not always been on their best behavior towards women.
        Almost all of them actually understand the bear meme.
