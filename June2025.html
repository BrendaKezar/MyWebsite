          <p>
            Apologies for the late post. Things have been very busy around here
            lately, especially with the complications from hubby's ankle surgery
            (wound isn't healing; not a serious issue yet, but could be, so it
            requires weekly trips to Fargo to keep it taken care of).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we aren't camping this year, I've been trying to make sure I
            take Penny walking in the woods every weekend. It's been tough,
            though, because it's been way hotter than normal. And, just like a
            few summers ago, we are having a lot of days where wildfires in
            Canada blanket our area in smoke (I'd rather have the smoke than the
            fires)
          </p>
          <p>And the ticks! Oh, lort. The ticks are SO bad.</p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="./images/Tick2025.jpg"
              alt="a tick on a truck"
              class="mypic"
            />
            <figcaption class="centered">
              Here's a tick crawling over the truck trying to get at Greg and
              Penny inside
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I took her out to Rydell Wildlife Refuge last weekend, and I picked
            at least 100 ticks off her (not hyperbole!) She even had one try and
            bite into her eyelid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ticks are so bad, I even had one bite into me. Normally, I'm
            super diligent about doing tick-checks and get them all off me
            before any have a chance to dig in, but they overwhelmed me with
            their sheer numbers and I missed one...until I had my big fat
            allergic reaction to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a tick bites me, it doesn't just itch, it burns like someone
            has laid a match on the bite spot. And it won't stop until the tick
            is gone. Once I remove the tick, the bite spot turns into a lump,
            like a mosquito bite. But it gets very firm and sticks around for a
            long time. I'm assuming it has something to do with my immune system
            walling off the tick spit or something.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I try and make sure not to let any ticks bite me. They are
            impossible to avoid altogether, unless I stay out of the woods.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's not happening. I'll take my lumps (literally) as the
            price for an outdoor life.

          <h5>This month's writing update.</h5>
          <p>
            I had plans to do Story A Day and even submitting some of the
            February stuff, but none of that happened. It wasn't even an issue
            of writer's block; I just didn't give it any of my time. I've just
            not been feeling it as a priority. Until I get into that mindset
            again ("writing is important"), I'm not going to get any writing
            done.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we will have to see how June goes, and if I'm able to get myself
            to make writing a priority again.

          <h5>What I'm reading this month.</h5>
          <p>
            Unlike writing, my reading went well in May. I read
            <cite>Never Whistle at Night</cite>, edited by Shane Hawk and
            Theodore C. Van Alst Jr., and I enjoyed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I generally prefer anthologies over novels because I prefer short
            stories and enjoy the "buffet" that a mixed-author anthology
            provides. This book was a perfect example of that because the
            stories ranged from "so literary as to be almost incomprehensible"
            to "good gory horror" to "weird horror with a heavy dose of
            comedy"...and everything in-between.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this time, I didn't miss the book club that was meeting to
            discuss the book! Yay!
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the discussion at the book club and decided to go ahead
            and try the next scheduled read:
            <cite>Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Fairies,</cite> by Heather
            Fawcett.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, I thought I'd hate it. I don't care for books about the
            fae and I'm generally apprehensive about books with these sort of
            female protagonists because I'm afraid they will either be "cozy" or
            "romantic," neither of which I like.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so far, I'm happy to say I was very wrong! I like the
            characters, the subject is keeping me engaged (even though it's the
            fae), and though a romance component does eventually develop, it's
            held at arm's length (if that makes sense) and more of an "it is
            what it is" rather than a swooning dance toward a happy ending.
          </p>
          <p>
            (I know that makes little sense for those who haven't read the book.
            The main character and her "foil" have a long-term colleague
            relationship that she, as a hermit of sorts, is annoyed by. But she
            also sometimes enjoys it. And once it comes out that he loves
            her--blunt and with a sort-of marriage proposal--she regards it
            rather scientifically; she ponders it and realizes, "Oh, that's why
            I hate him so much and yet really enjoy his company. Somewhere along
            the line, I caught feelings for him, too. Well, I'm not marrying
            him. That's just dumb.")
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really enjoying reading it, and I'm looking forward to the next
            book club meeting! This book club tends to read more in the spec fic
            genre, so I think I'll have a good shot at enjoying the books for
            it.

          <h5>What I'm learning this month/class report.</h5>
          <p>Remember when I was worried about my fall university class?</p>
          <p>
            <quote>
              But my online class is two combined classes, a 460 and a 560, with
              a class capacity of 40 between both...and I'm one of the eight
              people signed up!</quote
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation has improved, but only slightly. There are now 13
            people signed up for 460, and ONE signed up for 560.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm sure more people will sign up once it's closer to fall, but I'm
            pretty sure they wouldn't cancel it, even with these low enrollment
            numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my other "classes," most are the same. I'm still doing
            Duolingo and Dreaming in Spanish. I finished the Skill Success
            Spanish class I was doing, so now I'm trying a Spanish class through
            Udemy to replace it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still learning Java through Udemy, and full-stack developer
            through Codecademy. I'm still in Javascript at Codecademy, and I
            like it so much, I've added an Udemy Javascript course.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still taking "The Complete Mindfulness & Meditation Training
            (MBSR+MBCT)" through Udemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also jumped back into the "Introduction to Biology" class at
            Udemy. I had been flip-flopping between it and the Biology at EdX
            (particularly since I got a free year subscription to EdX that
            allows me to earn certificates without paying extra), but I really
            dislike the way EdX courses are organized. I struggled and gave up
            on CS50 as well as the biology course I had started taking there.
            I'm just so over EdX.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to do one lesson per day in each of my course/apps/programs,
            and it works out to be around an hour a day on learning. It' works
            out well, but we'll see how it goes once I go back to doing a
            regular university class in the fall.

            My favorite "exercise" has always been walking. When I can't walk in
            the woods, I walk on my treadmill. But I've struggled with something
            to keep the treadmill walking as interesting as walking in the
            woods.
          </p>

            Years ago, I tried to walk to music. That didn't work out because I
            tend to either lose focus on the walking by dancing (dangerous at my
            age) or by getting wrapped up in trying to "find a decent song." .
          </p>
          <p>
            So then I started to try and use walking time to get through my
            massive "To be watched" movie list. That didn't work out because I
            never walk long enough to watch a whole movie. So I'd have to pause
            and return later, and then I would forget what was going on in the
            movie and have to rewind to get myself back up to speed. It was a
            pain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, really good movies would cause me to lose focus. I almost
            busted out my front teeth when I fell of the treadmill while
            watching <cite>Train to Busan</cite>. The movie got to a suspensful
            part, and I held my breath...and forgot to keep walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            So then I tried watching shows, either on streaming or live TV.
            That's okay, but if the epsiode is boring, it makes walking a chore.
          </p>
          <p>
            So recently, I circled back to something I used to do a long time
            ago: watch walking videos, aka "Virtual Hikes."
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to have an app on my phone that had videos of people filming
            the path ahead of them while they walked. Think "first-person
            shooter," but the protagonist is holding a camera and just filming
            the path they are walking. These videos included everything from
            walking in famous cities to remote wilderness locations. The app had
            20 or so free ones, and required a subscription afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, during one of my phone upgrades, I didn't bother
            installing/moving the app to the new phone. And that app is no
            longer available. There are a few other apps now, also subscription
            based, but I'm not interested in yet another subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I've found several youTube channels that do the same thing,
            for free. I'm also happy to say that the production values are much
            better these days. My original app seemed like the people filming
            were using a camera strapped to them (early GoPro, maybe?), so there
            was occasionally some camera jostling when moving over rough
            terrain. Not so anymore. I don't know how they do it, but it seems
            like the cameras are on some sort of float system. There's no
            bouncing or jostling, just smooth walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite videos are ones that involve walking through puddles
            because then you also get the "feedback" of the "splish, splish,
            splish" when you walk, as well as the visuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm toying with the idea of learning how to make these kinds of
            videos. I can't tell you how much it would improve my morale to be
            able to do a virtual walk through the summer trails of Turtle River
            State Park (and ALL my favorite North Dakota and Minnesota parks) in
            January when it's -40 outside.
