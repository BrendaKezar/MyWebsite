          <h5>Writing update</h5>
          <p>
            Still working on getting my writing mojo back. Still doing a lot of
            false-starts with short stories and getting nowhere. However, the
            Writers Conference is coming up in a few months. Maybe that will
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've made a little bit of progress on my big nonfiction project, but
            not as much as I'd like. I have a little bit of an excuse this
            month. Not a great excuse, but an excuse nontheless: I lost my
            office. It was been taken over by roof/attic construction, so I had
            to move my office and writing space downstairs to the art studio.
            It's cramped, and my stuff is upstairs in the regular office, so I'm
            a little hobbled. No, I don't deal with change/adversity well.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of this week, I was able to move back into my regular office, so
            now the excuse is gone, lol.
          </p>

          <h5>Reading Update</h5>
          <p>
            I just finished up <cite>Nightbitch</cite>, and I have SO MANY mixed
            feelings.
          </p>
          <p>SPOILERS AHEAD</p>
          <p>
            On the one hand, I love the premise. It's a feminist work on how
            motherhood is not for everyone and how domesticity can stifle some
            women, while others thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is written with an unreliable narrator. Is this bitch crazy,
            or is she really turning into a dog? I knew, going in, that it might
            be a problem for me. I don't mind an unreliable narrator for a
            while, but I can't accept it for the whole story. Eventually, I need
            an answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, in most cases, if the whole premise has been a lie, I don't
            like it. That's part of the reason I have rage about many of
            Shamalan's works. When I found out that the "monsters" in The
            Village were just imaginary and created so that the children
            wouldn't explore and discover there was a world beyond the bounds of
            the "utopian compound," I just about flipped a damn table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't get me wrong; I love a good twist, a la
            <cite>Twilight Zone</cite>, etc., but there's a fine line between a
            surprise twist and feeling like you've been lied to the whole time.
            One is a twist; the other a ruse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides that, with this book, every time you feel like celebrating
            some of her little feral victories, like, "Yas, queen! You be wild
            and free and to hell with anyone who doesn't get it," something
            extreme happens in the plot and leaves you, once again, feeling like
            this bitch is crazy (and maybe her husband and everyone around her,
            too).
          </p>
          <p>
            So one minute she's goofing and playing doggie with her kid, and
            everyone around her is watching and judging her, and you feel like,
            "No, Boo, you do you. Life is too short! Have fun. Let the haters
            hate."
          </p>
          <p>
            And then the next minute, she's brutally killing the family cat.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I decided to watch the movie for more understanding. And it made
            things much worse. More on the movie in the next section.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I've moved on to Louise Erdrich's
            <cite>The Nightwatchman</cite>. It's an in-between book, as I'm
            considering joining some bookclubs, but I don't want to read and
            finish books too far ahead of the bookclub meetings. One book club
            meets at the end of February to discuss
            <cite>The Mighty Red</cite> (also by Erdrich), and one meets in
            March to discuss <cite>Watership Down</cite> (my favorite book since
            the fourth grade). I'm really looking forward to both!
          </p>

          <h5>What I'm watching this month</h5>
          <p>I actually watched a few different movies recently!</p>
          <p>
            We watched <cite>Dear Santa</cite> with Jack Black. It was cute and
            fun, and a little silly, of course. I may have a bias since the
            movie included a scene about a hamster, lol. There just aren't
            enough hamsters in movies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plot is that a little boy with dyslexia (and bad luck) writes a
            letter to santa...only he gets the letters reversed, and Jack Black
            (Satan) shows up instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the movie develops, you realize there is a little more to the
            plot than just the misunderstanding caused by the boy's dyslexia.
            This keeps the movie from being total silly fart jokes and such.
            This elevates it above the level of say, an Adam Sandler or Ben
            Stiller movie, and gives it a more heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also watched <cite>Mother of the Bride</cite>, a rom-com starring
            Brooke Shields and Benjamin Bratt. The premise is that they were
            engaged in high school (college? can't remember) and had a bad
            break-up without closure. Then years later, they run into each other
            at the destination wedding...of their children. Her ex's son is
            marrying her daughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's cute and funny and a feel good comedy about never being too old
            for love.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other movie I watched was the complete, freaking opposite:
            <cite>Nightbitch.</cite>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I read it, I considered the book to be maybe literary or
            mainstream. After reading it, I was left perplexed how to classify
            it. Some of the graphic violence in the book almost elevates it to
            horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movie, however, actually tones a lot of that down. There's one
            scene that dances at the edge of body horror...and makes no sense at
            all. It's almost like it was added for gross-out purposes.
          </p>
          <p>SPOILERS AHEAD</p>
          <p>
            In the book, she mentions she is growing a tail. In the movie, she
            discovers a giant lump where a tail would be. So she grabs a needle
            so big it looks like a knitting needle (but it's in the bathroom;
            what the hell was that needle even for???). She jabs it into the
            lump, and suddenly we are watching something that Dr. Pimple Popper
            would be proud of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, as this stuff oozes down her butt crack and into her pants
            (and I'm gagging), she pokes her finger into the hole, dislodging
            more goo, and pulls out a wad of hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Oh!" I think. "This is where she finds her tail. That's just some
            loose fur she's grabbed, and her tail is going to pop out any
            second."
          </p>
          <p>Nope.</p>
          <p>
            She pulls and pulls until she's pulled out a foot-long string of
            wadded hair, like something you'd pull out of the shower drain.
            That's it. She just had a shower-drain's worth of hair trapped under
            her skin. She gives a satisfied smirk, and end scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movie did nothing to resolve the questions of the book, and even
            made more of its own. For example, in the book, she kept talking
            about how she would turn into a dog. In the book, you could wonder
            if the transformatons were real or just her delusions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the movie, that's harder to pull of because it's visual...either
            the character is a dog or she isn't.
          </p>
          <p>However...</p>
          <p>
            It is established early on in the movie, and repeated throughout,
            that what is happening might not be real. It's a technique used in
            other movies, and used A LOT in comedy. A scene starts with a
            husband giving some ridiculous platitude to his wife. She rears back
            with her arm and smacks the living shit out of him. Quick cut to
            black, and then the scene repeats. This time, however, the wife
            responds by smiling and saying sweetly, "That's good advice. I will
            try that."
          </p>
          <p>
            With that as a repeated basis in the movie, you can't be sure if the
            scenes where you are seeing the woman as a dog are real, or if they
            are more of the imaginary scenes and the second shot showing the
            real scene isn't shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then there are plot elements that are completely changed that
            change the entire tone of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            One critical plot point (in my opinion), is the demise of the family
            cat. In the book, this happens when the main character is totally
            100% human. Because she's human, and because her son walks in
            afterwards, it has certain connotations. Oh my gosh, this woman is
            crazy. Oh, poor cat, it just wanted love from it's human. Oh, lort.
            The son is forever scarred from the doggy games because he's
            untouched by the death of the cat in a human way, and instead
            responds in a doggie way: "We eat?"
          </p>
          <p>
            In the movie, the cat is killed by the main character while she is
            in dog form, outside, playing with other dogs, and the son is
            nowhere around. That entirely changes the tone. The human "is a
            dog," the cat walked outside where dogs were, and the boy is a
            secondary participant in the whole thing later, when he is part of
            the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
            So while I had to sit through a completely gratutious pimple scene,
            the cat scene is watered down, even though doing so completely
            changes an integral part of the audiences perception of the main
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mean, frustated human brutally kills family cat in the kitchen as
            it begs for love, versus, human in dog form follows instincts and,
            while riled up and frolicking with other dogs outdoors, kills cat
            that comes outside into the doggy zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with my love of horror, I don't like to see violence against
            animals in movies, but they could have pulled the original plot off
            without actually showing violence against an animal. We all knew
            what was happening in the shower scene in Psycho without actually
            seeing a knife pierce flesh. So they could have preserved the
            original plot without actually showing a cruelty scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            A similar plot change happens with the ending, when the main
            character has her big art show. In the book, she puts on an art
            installation that displays her truth and her brutality to the world.
            It leads to protestations from animal rights groups about 'what
            happens to those poor real bunnies.' In the movie, it's all
            skeletons she's spray-painted gold and taxidermy.
          </p>
          <p>So, overall rating? Not a fan. Not of the book, nor the movie.</p>
          <p>
            So<cite>Mother of the Bride</cite> beats Jack Black, and
            <cite>Nightbitch</cite> comes in seventh (out of three).

          <h5>Classes Update</h5>
          <p>
            I cannot even believe I passed my class. The whole semester was SUCH
            a struggle. I started out hobbled by the fact that I didn't know
            Python programming. Then, of my own fault, I got behind and had to
            play catch-up. There was no real textbook for the class, and the
            professor's teaching style did not mesh with my learning style.
          </p>
          <p>And somehow, I pulled off a B.</p>
          <p>
            The funny (and frustrating) part was that no matter what I did, I
            didn't test well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first test, I was unprepared and scared because I didn't know
            what it would be like. And I had fallen behind on the materials. So
            I did terribly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second test, I studied my ass off for. And now the "unknown"
            element was gone and I knew what the format of the tests would be.
          </p>
          <p>And I scored one point lower than the first test. WTF?</p>
          <p>
            For the third test, I was frustrated and worn out. I stayed caught
            up on the class, and I studied a little, but given that score #2 was
            worse than score #1, I didn't bother to study as much. I just
            studied a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            And test score number 3 was two or three points less than test score
            number 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sigh. So no matter what I did...keep caught up, fall behind, study
            my ass off, don't study at all, study a medium amount...I was pretty
            much getting almost the same score every time. I don't even know how
            that works!
          </p>
          <p>
            But I did learn a lot. In particular, I learned I like Java. So now
            that's what I'm learning through Udemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            And speaking of Udemy, I completed my HTML Bootcamp and added that
            to my certificate collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still working through the full-stack developer course at
            Codecademy, slowly but surely.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still learning Spanish through Duolingo, but I've stopped
            Spanish at Skillshare. The course I had been taking there did verb
            conjugations very differenly than in Duolingo, so it was really
            confusing me.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the university, my class this semester is my internship. I am
            VERY trepidated. I have no idea how this whole thing is going to
            work, and how to integrate the whole thing into my job. We will see
            how it goes!

          <h5>Website Update</h5>
          <p>I have been wiffle-waffling about website hosting for a while.</p>
          <p>
            Since I hope to get my writing mojo back at some point, I really
            wanted to make sure I keep some sort of website going, whether
            that's Wordpress or HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, because I like to play with programming and web development, I
            really need a host where I can have more freedom to design from
            scratch in HTML, CSS, and eventually Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I've been running with two websites, with the intention of
            eventually dropping Wordpress. It's just too expensive to run with
            two web hosts. My little Wordpress site isn't too expensive on it's
            own, but when you add in html hosting ($150 plus), I was paying $250
            plus per year. And these days, I just feel so oversubscribed for
            EVERYTHING! Periodically, I go through "subscription rebellion"
            phases where I randomly cancel stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's where I was with the website. I was going to not renew my
            Wordpress and just move the whole site over to HTML hosting.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then...I came up with my big nonfiction project. And my
            nonfiction project is actually going to require a store, should I
            ever get it completed. My HTML skills are not to the point where I
            can create my own store. I would need a site that can provide most
            of that functionality itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I had an author site at Wordpress that wasn't being used (as
            I'm not writing), and an expensive html host that I was paying for
            just for recreational purposes, and a potential nonficton project
            that circles back to writing and would require a shopping cart site.
            So the logical thing is to cancel the HTML site, keep the Wordpress
            site, AND, if I should get my nonfiction project completed, then
            upgrade the Wordpress site to include a store.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, like a big baby, I don't want to do that. The HTML part is the
            most fun! I don't want to give that up! But the grown-up in me says
            that paying that much for "just for fun" isn't adulting!
          </p>
          <p>
            So I settled on a compromise. I've decided that I'm going to try out
            hosting the HTML part of my site on Github now, and I'm going to
            cancel the current HTML host. The Wordpress site will remain to keep
            my author site alive.
          </p>
          <p>However, this means there will be one.more.port. Sigh.</p>
          <p>
            Links to the blog posts will once again have to be rebuilt. As of
            this post, the site is just forward looking. Meaning, older posts,
            particularly those accessed through Wordpress, will likely be broken
            for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time permits, I will work on fixing the links to 2024 posts
            first, and then work my way back through years prior (some of which
            are still broken from the last time I ported my site!). Hopefully,
            the Github solution works well enough I can just get the html part
            of the site, including archives, built there for good and not have
            to port them again!

          <h5>Homeowner Hell</h5>
          <p>
            This post is already way too long, but since I mentioned "Homeowner
            Hell" and losing my office earlier in the post, I should share the
            rest of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            So several Saturday's ago (at least a month, maybe two), the weather
            suddenly warmed up over 40 degrees. And as I walked up from doing
            laundry in the basement, I heard this weird "pit, pat, pit, pat"
            noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tracked down the noise, and it was water dripping from one of the
            recessed lights in the kitchen. As I watched, more drips appeared at
            other spots in my kitchen ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            My heart sank. We just moved into this house six years ago, and had
            the roof redone five years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            I threw towels around to soak up the water. But...I was still
            hearing a pit-pat-pit-pat noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            I rushed upstairs and looked at the ceiling in the gym. No leaks.
            But I could still hear the noise. And then I glanced over at the gym
            window.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gym window isn't very good. Every winter, it frosts over
            terribly. And then it melts and soaks the windowsill as the weather
            warms up. So to prevent that until we get it replaced (part of
            homeownership is a long list of projects that you are EVENTUALLY
            going to get around to, but that you never seem to actually get to),
            we just put plastic over it every winter before it gets too cold. It
            solves the problem nicely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gym window had turned into an aquarium. Literally. Nearly a foot
            of water trapped between the plastic and the window itself. I could
            have dropped my goldfish into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon investigation, water was coming down through a weephole in the
            top of the window and getting trapped in in-between the plastic and
            the window itself. On the plus side, I learned that the window and
            the seals around the frame are very, VERY good. Good enough to hold
            water and keep it from leaking into the wall!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, to keep the story from getting too long, there were problems
            with the roof and attic. We had to have multiple contractors/water
            mitigators, etc., come through to diagnose the problems. And the
            only access to the attic is through my office.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the problem was just to leave everything ready for someone
            to inspect all the time (tools, lights, a ladder, etc.). The second
            part of the problem was that every time someone looked or went into
            the attic, they would drag "attic junk" back out with them. So the
            office was under a constant state of contamination. Blown-in
            insulation, mouse debris, loads of dead bugs, and, occasionally,
            feathers! Which may mean bird poo.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of it good for me to breathe; none of it good for the dogs to
            eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than doing a deep clean every other day, I opted to relocate
            the office.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing I'm really thankful for is that we decided to use the
            rooms in the house for odd purposes. The dining room is our living
            room, the living room is a gym...and the master bedroom is my
            office.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know if I would have been able to deal with a constant
            parade of workers tromping through my bedroom OR having to choose
            between doing a daily deep clean or relocating the bedroom!
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, the main problem has been resolved for the winter and I was
            able to move back into my office. No more leaks anywhere and the
            water should be resolved. In the spring, we still have to have
            contractors back out to do some roof work, replace some sheeting,
            and do some other repairs.
